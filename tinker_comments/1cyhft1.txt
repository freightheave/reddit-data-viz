Nerfed is a nice way of putting it. Obliterated is the right word
    Oh my god I’m devastated how will I carry on?
        I like you...
We will probably not see tinker in any games for the next few years, they literally killed him
    How will the Russians with 7 year old anime girls in their profile pictures survive?
        They will still pick him and use him the same way, and realize the hard way rearm was "fixed".... then do it the same the next day.

People are still attempting sf arcane blink + ult, ages after the arcane blink doesnt increase cast speed anymore, causing the team to lose
            I wonder if we're going to see yasha Kaya shafowfiends now with the cast speed reduction 
I can finally stop seeing my therapist!
Oh no! Anyway...
I rarely encountered him in my low immortal games, when I did I could just go afk because those who played him destroyed everything 

FCK this hero
I'll drink to that

techies treatment looong overdue
Noice
I haven't read the patch but the last time ppl thought that tinker was dead, he was stomping pubs like crazy. When they removed march of the machines
Not too happy about this nerf, but let me explain.  
I'm not tinker player first of all.  
But if Valve is gonna nerf a hero (any hero) to the point that it can't be played, it's the same as removing it from the game.  
I don't want any heroes removed from the game, even the OP ones - I just want them balanced, not USELESS.
Not nerfed they fucking blew his Body up
Dont think its a nerf boys, hes at 57% win rate in divine/immortal
    Where'd you get those stats from, out of your ass?

[https://stratz.com/heroes/meta/trends?bracketIds=IMMORTAL](https://stratz.com/heroes/meta/trends?bracketIds=IMMORTAL)

Currently at 26.9% in immortal
        An hour after the patch he was at 57% win rate, I see now it corrected to dumpstertier
    And blademail doesn’t really bother him on March anymore
How was he nerfed I looked it up, there really doesn't seem to be this massive hero killing nerf. I mean they even brought back march of the machines
    Item cooldown rearm gone
