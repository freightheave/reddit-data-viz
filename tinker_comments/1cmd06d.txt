Back dragon form is fucking massive though
    BBD what do you expect
        When I get aghs on DK I always say BBD ready!
    Ups. I read it as “Bad dragon form is fucking massive though”.
I didn’t know ppl hated this, I just treat this and Mirana as model updates cause the existing one is just so old
    Yeah but everyone got Mirana persona cause of the decade anniversary. This was a timed exclusive
        At the rate that they drop persona sets it feels hopeful that we can get DK soon as well
            I’ve been waiting for wisp Arcana to make a return for nearly 8 years.
    I don't hate, but DK has so many amazing sets that is hard to choose
        The viking one is just godly
            I mysef prefer the grandpa knight set
                sad i couldnt get my hands on this one, or even the blue knight one
                    Go to dotagiftx my friend or dm me I can get you one for 20 usd, you just have to wait 30 days xd
        Knight of the Burning scales 

I still regret not being able to get it I don't think it's even tradable what a bloody shame
    Because the default DK has so many cool armors.
But I like this with the cape and smug face tho.
        this persona actually triggers me when he denies my creeps
    Insulting to Tony Todd to say this
        Don't worry the Candyman will get them
    that would be a model update if it actually let you use normal items with it..
    I wish it were an actual model update, since both of these heroes have so many amazing sets you can't use with the persona, so I ended up not using them at all
    persona's cool but dk just has way too many cooler set lol
    I'd play DK if I could use this persona. The normal DK dragon form is just way too janky though.
    Dota 2 subreddit has been a hate boner mode for everything for years
    I like the way it looks most of the time, its his running pose/cycle that I cant stand. since you're moving a lot of the time in dota, it just makes the whole persona stupid. 

plus they've not done anything to add to them. personally I feel like they should just invest in re-doing the entire game with a new coat of paint with these styles, make it still connect back to the servers in the same way so people can choose which visuals they want to play with.
        Make it like smtie 2 all cosmetics are not to be reused or just to be resold
id like just one set for him so that i can get him tbh
    yup, just buy the set for the persona, thats what i did for Wei, now her set's proce skyrocketed
        Which set was that?
        What, how?? I want the Wei persona badly
            if you want the persona, buy the bundle set and you'll get the persona for free
                It has to be the bundle? You can't buy the pieces individually if you don't have the persona already?
Thx for your help btw
                    no, i dont think you will get the persona if you buy the sets' pieces individually iirc, im happy to help...also, dont bother buying wei's set rn its super expensive, id rather wait for the next wei set to come out, and it will, probably...good luck on getting that persona
    If they arent going to make Kaden into a hero, just do the Kaden suit
    [deleted]
        because i like it?
        "Because I don't like it, nobody should like it."
            true
        Still looks better than the mid-life crisis motorcycle-buying dude whose kids cut contact a few years ago, the default one
Weird to see that everyone hates this persona. This is literally (if we dont count the mirana remodel) the only persona I always use
    It's very boring. While it is higher quality than default DK it's even more generic than him.
        it's purpose it to tell your friends "hey im playing human knight"
            With a longsword no less
        >It's very boring.

Wow they captured DK essence so well
            Whaaaat, nooooo, he so interesting
        Wait, what came first, this model or the animation series? Just got started playing DoTA after watching the animation series.
            The animation series. The model was launched after, same with Miranas. Its sad they don't give it any more skins tho :*(
            I want to say the series was first and the set came up pretty quickly after.
            The anime actually made you want to play the game?  After S2 finale I completely stopped watching it, maybe not being familiar with the characters helps keep your investment?
                Sorry, didn't mean it made me play DOTA 2, more like, it made me play DOTA AGAIN, because I already played DOTA 1.
        I also just like default DK’s voice a lot
        It’s not boring if you enjoyed the anime
        >While it is higher quality than default DK

Literally generic-ass armor, made in cartoon style. This is something that belongs to TF2, but not Dota 2, even in 2021...
        > It's very boring.

So is playing DK, so it fits. It's a pretty sad set though in terms of flash.
    It looks like a generic knight from some shitty free-to-play mobile game advertisement
        That's basically what Dragon Knight looks like anyway.
            Nah the real DK has some banger sets. Even his default has some very distinct and unique characteristics.

Edit: Now that i look at them, i'm quite confident in saying DK has the best selection of item sets in the game, when excluding immortals and arcanas. He has so many great sets. Third Awakening, Scorched Amber, Silverwurm Sacrifice, Dragon's Ascension, Pact of the Wyrmblood, Legacy of the Eldwurm Crest, Outland Ravager, Bitterwing Legacy and Blazing Oblivion.
                I like some of dks sets but he's got a lot of jaggy old and dull ones.
I'm not a sven player but even his old ones look unique and cool.
                > Nah the real DK has some banger sets

So you're comparing a base skin to years of cosmetics and immortals? 🤔
                    >  Even his default has some very distinct and unique characteristics.
                        Like what? If his default was a spice it'd be flour.
                            Oh come on. The layered wing-like pauldrons? The design of his faceplate to evoke a dragon? The tail on his helmet? The sculpted, scaled chestplate? The little dragon claw details on his wristguards? His default skin is iconic. Yeah it's old as the heaven itself and is a bit dated as a result, but it's not mobile game boring
                Have you ever looked at Jugg's items? I suggest you do
                    He has cool sets, and some of the best in the game, but fewer than DK in my opinion. Looks are subjective after all. Off the top of my head, Jugg has 4 really cool sets excluding arcanas and immortals
        Dota 2 has been in this mode since the beginning isn’t it
    It looks blander than the initial AM Persona, and that one was touched up after the initial complaints about it.

Also DK has really good sets, all of which cannot be used with his persona.

Who wants to play a bland scrawny boy, if you can play as a chad man?
        > Who wants to play a bland scrawny boy, if you can play as a chad man?

Seeing as A) There's no other scrawny boys in the game and B) he's got that cool wrist blade, I do. Or would, if I had it.
            Where are our twinks?
        I thought the original AM persona was very well designed personally. The PA persona is a bigger offender of being generic IMO
            That one is mainly bad cause of the wet noodle attack sound.
    Kinda sad its like having a nude DK. But I do enjoy that he has more personality than default DK.
    It's incredibly boring. Has no personality whatsoever,it's just a generic anime warrior.
        So like default DK? The only difference is DK is generic old-school MMORPG warrior.
            don't try to argue with them, it would have been the same persona but with a vagina instead of a penis it would have been as popular as anti-mage persona. And don't worry they'll say yeah i love monsters and badasses characters but the only monster they play is either spectre or the good looking monkey king.
                no see the thing about the antimage persona is that they actually released sets for it :))

or the axe one which is actually interesting
            yeah except the base dk has cool as fuck sets whereas this one has jack shit
    I own the 2015 Cache set and it's the best looking DK
    Helmet > Face in literally every situation ever. Get these dang kids some helmets they always look better.
        I never in my entire life used the helmet, even through i have it
    Its my favorite
    It's cus I am roleplaying as Davion from the anime bruh
    No thighs no buys.
    It has worse cast animations than the default DK.
        I like his attack animations a lot tho. Really satisfying to last hit with.
I’ve never cared for it tbh. It’s diet dragon knight imo
    Handsome dragon knight
        white dragon knight
            blue eyes white dragon knight
                suck on my obelisk
                    ride the sky dragon
Is it on the market?
    no
i really want this persona
    do you have the es arcana? im gonna trade with you :)
        starter pack scammer.
whats wrong with u?
I like this one. Would be nice to get some alts.
They put time and love into it. I don't know where the hate comes from.
I’d pay good money for this and/or the axe unleashed personas. Makes me so sad I have neither.
    Me to
DK/Mirana persona should be used more for sets moving forward imo. Specially since persona mirana doesn't need a mask to look fine.
My favorite imo ( i dont have it tho :( )
I wish they would bring it back just cause I want Tony Todd’s dragon form voice lines
I have watched that shit twice and I still dont understand half the story of dragons blood
    It's some random nonsense with dota characters tossed in the mix
        Disagree. The story is about love and grief and how Invoker would do anything so that his daughter could live.
            Invoker and dragon knight story is the only half I got, all the selemene and mirana bs I have no clue about.
            Then they should call it DotA -  Carl's Quest and not Dragons Blood, cos the whole dragon and mirana stuff was a mess
                Tell Valve that they should've spent more on the anime or Netflix to be less restrictive or cheap because the show needed and deserved more episodes. I was honestly impressed by how much story they were able to pack in their very limited runtime.

Regardless, the dragons were relevant because Terrorblade needed all their souls to remake the world in his image and this goal Invoker used to further his own goal. So it's the big players getting all these smaller players intermixed in their plots; so Davion is involved because the dragons are involved because Terrorblade and Invoker are involved and Invoker knows Selemene and Fymryn stole her lotuses and so Mirana gets involved and Mirana meets Davion and they later meet Invoker and Fymryn, etc. etc. You copy? xD
                    Downvoted? You guys are no fun.

I know the show has flaws but what I'm trying to point out is that there's a very good story underneath and a very solid production throughout, despite their limitations.
                        You know, I have some gripes with DB and all but all things considered, for only just 3 seasons, the show managed to churn out something pretty damn epic: Fantasy, class war, politics, religion and even a bit of sci-fi at the end.
                        Yeah tbh I thought it was okay, it was also all explained quite clearly IMO, the dragons are seperate from reality on one of the planes of existence, and they each represent one of pillars of creation. One for each of the "attributes" which I guess is like the elements, and one for all the forces. To simplify it, the red dragon was exort, in order to create a new universe you would need all the dragons souls as they are what reality is built upon. 

Since Davion had the Dragons blood, he became part of the pillars, so when reality ended he was kept...

I thought it was okay. I do wish there was more though. When I first heard an anime was being made I hoped it was going to be like retellings of all the characters story's, so each season we followed a different group of the dota hero's and how they all interacted with each other. So mirana, dk etc, one with alchemist and brood mother etc etc
Looks like a Fortnite character lol
The immortal shield is too cool to not use
Shame no sets for him cos really would like to get the persona.. it's the one thing I regret not getting way back when. 😔
one of the most boring heroes, together with underlord
    You are just jealous because he's a real Dragon and you are a lame Wyvern.
        That's ironic, with WW's ingame voicelines to DK being her telling him that he's nothing but a filthy half-breed, and barely even a dragon.
            Classic jelly beans
        lol
    Have you seen Underlord's ass when he walks

It's very cute
    Nothing boring about being an unstoppable monster that still does damage!!
        It's actually impressive that they managed to take a hero who can get hundreds of points of bonus damage and make him the most boring offlaner in the game. Buy greaves and stand around. Use giant AoE abilities that are easy to use. Even his ult is literally just a twin gate. You can't even use it for any kind of cool surprise attacks because it shows on everyone's map through fog.
            It is great for mind games though.  Put it a little off center behind a tower you're pushing where you know enemies are defending.  They have to figure out if it's a bait or not, idea is preferably put it somewhere out of vision, don't just plop it on top of enemies without the aghs, just leaves you vulnerable if you pop in like that usually.

Use it far ahead of fleeing weakened enemies too.
    The new Abyssal Underlord ult at least gives him some cool global presence, which doesnt require any unit as teleport target.

There are definitely more boring heroes than AU, such as Razor, Ursa and Naix.
        Naix is literally the most boring hero in the game right now.  

One of it's spell is just a BKB, so it isn't unique to this hero.  
The other two are passive right click and they aren't even interactive (like Slardar's or Monkey King's passive).  
The ulti is literally the only unique thing the hero has.  
The dude has literally one exclusive skill.
            Nothing wrong with a simple hero with 2 buttons to press though, the complexity doesn't come from the spells themselves, both Q and Ult can engage, chase or disengage, so it's all about how and at which moment you use them. Low skill floor but a high skill ceiling, I love how people are using Manta now to dispel/disjoint and ult the illusion.
            does anyone know why open wounds was removed
                It's on shard and it's way better than it would be allowed to be as a regular skill
            I miss skeleton king only thing you do is stun and right-click
            Laughs in wraith king.
                Which is why the hero got a shitton of reworks throughout the years and currently has 2 unique and interesting actives (nuke may be simple, but making all skeletons focus on the target makes it quite interesting), his passive became interactive (cooldown instead of just random proc chance) and his ulti gained a super interesting Agh's Scepter and skeletons on death.
            That's why Dota was the most successful MOBA map in Warcraft 3 days. 

You want to play easy to use hero, or you want to play high skillcap? 

Other maps focused on complicated gimmicks for every hero, with unique map objectives, this had higher depth of gameplay but then no one wanted to get started playing.
                Sure, but we can't just follow 2003 standards in 2024 and I'm pretty sure Valve agrees with that, considering Valve gave Naix Open Wounds back.
                    Then what would you suggest to make Naix better.
        Ursa may be a simple hero on paper but I find him one of the most satisfying heroes to play. Agreed on Razor for sure though
            But he's the only way i can make my dream of holding a leash with drow at the other end come true.
                Ayo
    i like them portal
Biggest mistake valve did, it should have been free for everyone, playinf with the heroes of the anime, exactly like the anime!
    Hi I work at valve what is this word you're using "free" what does it mean? /s
personally

regular dk animations > persona dk animations

regular dragon form < persona dragon form
No naked option, I wanted to see him run around in burnt pants since he spends 1/3 of the anime naked.
This persona is so much better than base DK and 90% of his sets
One step closer to the League aesthetics :(
Honestly, the should've made this his base model, alongside Mirana's persona. But I guess money speaks louder.
bro 248  set yet no void spirit? Srsly? is it really that hard?
I use it lol. But I think it has some pay to lose mechanics like cast timings or animations. They're slower than the original dragon knight
It looks awful imo. Its just so out of place.
I like it quite a bit, I think this more smooth anime style (same with e.g. marci, snapfire alot of the arcanas etc.) is the direction the dota2 artstyle should turn toward to make the game more aesthetically 

Normal DK just looks so clunky with some of his sets
    Ehy making fota 2 anime sthle, ? Dota 2 heroes wre more " realistic" than anime ztyle
This is really bad
It's for the good, it's extremely out of place in dota.
    as well as Marci so
        nah, his model just looks different, something close to Mirana's anime model, it really feels like something's wrong. Whereas Marci's model looks fine
            besides her being big af compared to other humans
                she's literally the same size as LK, DK, WR, TA, Omni, she isn't big, I just checked in the game
                    [https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/1cnzqqk/why\_is\_marci\_really\_big\_compared\_to\_the\_anime/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/1cnzqqk/why_is_marci_really_big_compared_to_the_anime/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)
                        And? There's not a single hero I mentioned on the image, only DK (who's the same height).
                Only her hands in some animation but relatively as tall as most hero
Good, avoids reminding me of what a let down that show turned into
    I thought Invoker and parts of the Luna/Mirana stories were neat but the dragon knight parts were pretty boring. It's crazy that there were a ton of cool side characters and we ended up getting Marci, who was more of a gag character than anything. I was convinced the Elf girl was going to be playable at some point.
        Me still hoping filloemene, or however you wrote invokers daughter, becomes invoker but with support spells, I would main the shit out of that
            I'd personally be happy with it as a second invoker arcana as well, femme invoker sounds like something I'd love to play

Tho your suggestion of invoker level spell variation but more supportive is also very interesting!
                I figured out a whole 9 spells she could use that would make her great, a lot are just invo spells with tweaked numbers and heals instead of DMG.
It would be so interesting to have a really complex heal support where it's not all about timing and positioning like Io or Oracle
                    Yeah that does actually sound cool
    It is unreasonably bad. The writing feels cliche as fuck.
Yeah this is a downer. I missed this one and theres like no chance of getting it since nobody making a set of him. I dont care about toy pudge and kidvoker, but theres like at least 3 different set each for them, and dont get me started on CM dog persona. Who tf even used that one?
    Hey i use cm persona, say whatever u want, the set is fire and the effect is amazing especially ult
    Dogy cm is the best we need more animalistic heros
The problem is this persona is too cartoony + not having the original voice actor do his voice in the anime is a travesty.
i know why everyone hates this arcana due to its plainness, but its still my fave one since its voiced by my fave VA lol
    “My name means something.”

I have this but stopped using it because the other armor sets are cooler. Also can’t knock the original VA lines. Slyrack’s voice is so deep.
I love his lines, I wish I could own it
Exactly like the anime
Hard to remember such mediocre skin, it is... just DK, but without helmet and with better textures
I wasn't into the "anime" at all, so maybe those peeps get more of a kick out of this persona.

I use neither this one nor the Mirana one, because I just like basic 5 cent cosmetics more. Still use a very simple cat mount for Mirana and some age-old cache set for DK.

The only good thing that made it from that show into the game is Marci.
A persona is meant for the hero to have a drastic change from their normal self. This persona changes nothing about DK. The only difference being he has no shield zi guess Lol.
I mean it's just DK from the anime. Not sure what else other cosmetics there is to add to that.
    Dk perosna unleashed
Also it's tricky to make skins for his persona since most of DK's sets covers his entire body and it's really hard to distinguish which is which.
I wish they made the animated series on some other hero from Dota. His story was not very appealing to me. Kind of a missed opportunity...
It should stay as it is. Super exclusive
I regret getting caught up in the hyper of whatever TI this was a part of but I got this and not Mirana and I'm full of regrets
I think it's the best honestly
The animations on this one look cursed af, but it's dota so idk what do I even expect
It’s cuz Davion has WAY cooler sets than his persona. Invoker, Pudge, Miranda, AM and PA are all pretty meh compared
Honestly? They should release more Dota: Dragon’s Blood personas… Invoker (and Filomena), Terrorblade, Luna, Lina, Crustal Maiden and Winter Wyvern. I’d buy them
Unpopular Opinion : Dragon Form on this arcana looks absolutely horrendous.
It has a slower base attack time than the original, literal pay2lose
This persona is like a downgrade from default
He was forgettable and generic in both character design and narrative in his own show.
I don't like it purely cause I prefer the og dragon knight lore not the anime
I wanted Naked Axe dammit!
i love this set
Is that bsj
I've missed it then, want it now
I don't like him. Generic anime protagonist.
wish i could have grabbed this and the mirana persona.
oh look its the Guts wanna be persona that nobody asked for.
More like forgettable persona. Like I’ll be real,DK and Mirana are the two most boring personas for me, not because they’re bad looking (debatably), but because they are at best glorified lore updates.

They are generic by design but that defeats the point of being a persona (a remotely different take on a hero) and defeats the point of a replacement for the original model (because it’s already generic by design).
It better be
Even more forgotten anime
Persona is just very mid and doesn't feel like dota hero
giff skins to our chad davion sama please ! Marci whistles
Lmao this dude hahahaha
Is that u garen
So sad I was poor when this came out
Such a terrible persona
We wants clown DK !!
bro just has no swag
This persona can't stop yapping. Actually titled me
I hated that guy so much in the series. The characters were really boring besides invoker and Lina. If they would have taken the story from crownfall... That would have been so much better
The animations are straight up bad.
I only use him for the dragon form. If I could mix and match the dragon with the regular dk I would.
    Yeah the dragon form of this persona is really good, being able to mix it would be great.
Absolutely love this persona, and helmet is damn great.

Sadly DK is boring ass hero that most of the time uses dragon skin anyway.
Definitely the weakest persona in my opinion. Except Slyrak, this Slyrak is one of the best looking.

I'd be happy to see a new set on him.
    For me the weakest would be PA persona. The textures look cardboard and the animations are so clunky. Especially the running animation, Asan look like he's jogging in place.
And replace Tony Todd's voice?? No thank you.
I love it because it’s minimalistic, one of my favourite personas/skin. Attack animation also feels so good
I hate that the dragon half is tied to this Persona. The Slyrak persona is god tier. The Davion one is meh.
    Facts
My problem with it is that they have some seriously cool DK sets already that cover up the fact it's an old AF model. I have a cool one from an old International that I use, + they released the Immortal shield cosmetic after the personal but didn't make it compatible. My problem is the problem I have with all the personas: the items I've spent 12 years collecting arent compatible with the personas. Same thing with Crystal Maiden and PA.
As boring as this persona really is, I wonder what will people cook for this guy if he is more appealing to others. He looks so bland you can fit him on any set (theoretically) like a pure white paper.
Why would you choose a footman instead of a knight?
What mobile game is this?
They really want you to forget about this show. Seeing how the Mirana is also forgotten. 

The only reason Marci is still relevant is because you can't hide a stand-alone hero, and her abilities are fun. Everything else is fine. 

Honestly, most new players won't even know about the show.

That said, I actually do like both the personas, but I really dislike both heroes.
I want that one so bad I wanna play as Sasuke !
Good.
I heard somewhere that his animation makes him P2Lose compared to the original. I think maybe BSJ said he's breath fire is slower or something but I'm not sure.
Probably better to play 3 Reload or 5 Royal than this mf dragon
I don't understand why they de-aged dragon knight. The original Dk is so much cooler, rewarded for an act of mercy, meanwhile this is just a guy dragged around by his powers. Then again it's not like they did justice to the rest either.
    Dk in the game is supposed to be older than DK in the anime, whom only just became part of Slyrak, rather than already being merged with him (which is why Tony Todd only voices the dragon form), instead of both.
        They are not the same dragon knight. Their stories don't match.
            Well, yes. But the reason for it is as stated above, where DK in the show is supposed to be younger (which he is).
                Plus, there are multiple timelines, both in the game and in the show.
It's just so obviously out of place like porting a fortnite skin directly into another game.
Shitty marketing
It's my favourite persona, too. 

We don't need the anime ultra powerup, do we?
Most personas are just a downgrade of default hero imo, but this one is also so incredibly boring on top of that. Like at least plushy pudge or kidvoker is kinda original, this guy feels like that default fortnite character model lol
Looks like a Fortnite skin
I would use it more if DK was fun to play
The worst pay to loose skin. Why code a new skins' turn rate slower than the original?
Honestly if valve released more cosmetics for the persona form the sheer possibilities is limitless
I think the hero just reads better as a grungier darker character in-game. Why make a cartoony DK when you could make a badass DK?
just like anime forgotten
He looks lesbian tbh
It's so bad.
like, he's not a twink, yes. but compared to the default DK this one is such a twink. downgrade of the character imo.
