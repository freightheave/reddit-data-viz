Tinker should be renamed as TinkTink. Cos you now need to think twice before picking it.
I don't play tinker much but I really liked him. I think his kit was really cool. And its super fun to watch tinker pros playing. 
People would disagree with me but I'm rather upset with valve.
    Bro the learning curve was too high for tinker. They already nerfed him a lot of the past patches and now the hero is in thrash.
        Agreed. Besides, he starts quite slow and needs items to gain movement. And players should be rewarded for learning heroes that are more difficult to learn.
Go to hell tinker players
Nah, he had it coming for a long, long time. It is very much deserved.
Same here. Feeling sad. Its a hard hero to play and master. And somehow valve is ok trashing a unique hero. Never mind gay ass 2 button heroes like sniper and bb being op. Man this game is becoming so boring and singular, its so stupid.
Finaly, I will enjoy the tears of tinker players for times to come.
