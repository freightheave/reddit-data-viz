I am a tinker player, and I agree that it is a pretty disgusting hero. But it takes hundreds of games to get to the level where I am to not only dominate mid lane, but all lanes by the time I get dagger. Thats hundreds of games when it was peak of the tinker meta, laser, rockets, and march. Only for valve to shit on it for the last 5 years. I can atleast still have fun with it in overthrow, but the recent patch? Not gonna happen anymore. I love Tinker and am waiting for it to become relevant again, to shit on some unsuspecting support that turned pig.
Idk it's been probably a year they I have legit encountered one that was problematic
Do u mean tinkled
FUCK TINKER FUCKING LOVE THAT THIS TRASH HERO IS GOING TO THE SHITTERS! ARC WARDEN NEEDS TO BE UP NEXT SMURFING PIECE OF TRASH HERO ASWELL
    Get a grip weirdo. Thanks for the second hand embarrassment.
