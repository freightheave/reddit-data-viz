32% winrate lmaoooooooooooo
    Keep it going down. Just remove this piece of shit out of the game
        Tell me you're herald without telling me you're herald.
            When hes even mediocre,

Que the clip where a 6 slotted terrorblade in pro game cc'd to death for 30 second by only tinker


No fun allowed,good riddance,rest in piss wont be missed
        I wonder how many games you play a week vs tinker (or in general) to even have such a dog shit opinion lol. Nyx exists, night stalker and tinker wards exist. But your night light is also made by valve so expanding your hero pool beyond whatever you spam now is a big leap for someone like you. So you would rather bitch on Reddit till it gets nerfed instead of being a better player xD xD
            Look! it's the tinker player nobody likes!
            Yeah still need to delete tinker
            ...shut up, Meg
            I'm playing Turbo, and just want to goof around with Ogre. I don't want Tinker smurfs dumping on my day on their road to 10 MMR.
                Why would somebody on his road to 10k would bother you in your Turbo games? Lol.
                    10 MMR (i.e. deboosting), not 10k MMR.
                        I see, then it's a good point. Haha..
    Finally my ban slot is free
        seems bizarre to waste a ban slot on a super unpopular hero

in the last year, tinker has been in **12** of my last 646 matches. so if i use a ban on him that would meaningfully prevent him from showing up in 3 of those 12 matches on average, so i'd only be banning tinker 3/646 = 0.46% of the time

i'd much much much rather spend a ban on a hero that im actually at a real risk of encountering on a regular basis
            If i knew I would have to play against old tinker even once out of a hundred games I would still ban him. He was the most unpleasant experience in the game after old techies. Good riddance
Dr. Kleiner, I can't move it move it anymore
MORE
    MORE!
good thing they nerfed tinker with his 40% winrate and 0 pro picks or whatever the fuck
    Thankfully this did solve the issue of tinker scripters in every 30 games or so.
    He had one of the highest mid lane winrates on immortal
    If pros aren't picking it anyways why not balance it for the low ranked players?
        You call this balance? lol lmao even
        the problem with heroes like tinker, brood, meepo etc.  
If you will make them stronger that low mmr players or just players who dont main these heroes could pick them and have 50% winrate it means that people who play only on these heroes will have 65% winrate and this is the problem with these heroes.
        LOL
        Broodmother smurf will make ur life 25x more miserable, better destroy an entire identity of 10 years or so.
I think he suffered enough. Look, I wanted March of the Machines back too, but not like this.

And Rearm doesn't refresh items? So he's gotta be in the thick of action just spamming laser and machines? But he's a squishy boy? What is this hero supposed to do?
    Forcestaff his @ss with freestyle wheelchair
No soul ring rearm, no blink rearm. Slapped with a pity cooldown reduction passive ( = nothing ). Heatseakers gone. 

After like 4 patches of nerfs, and an armor buff for whatever reason, the hero is dead. Dead and buried. 

Same as newest invoker orbs , stupid ideas and still not as interesting as the original ones.

Nvr mind tho, new patch, new shit to test, just not tinker until maybe 1 or 2 years for the patch to cycle back to it.
    It's only dead until someone figures out how to play him now. It hasn't even been 12 hours since the patch came out; the 32% you see there are probably people who are picking him without reading the patch notes and then discovering in game that items don't refresh.
        The identity was flash farming with March+Rearm, Travels back to base and do it again. You get massive networth lead and then rearm real shit like Shivas/Sheep. to steam roll and have the mana to spam lasers/rockets.

Without item rearms, I don't know what this hero does without Valve just tuning numbers up and him being good by virtue of insane numbers.
        It killed the core of the hero, there is no way around it. refreshing his own skills was always meh, he litteraly had 2 boring nukes and a shield, all of his kit was balanced around rearm. 

it's like changing invoker to have 4 static skills instead of invoke, it's the same genius idea guy that made megameepo, bristle aghs, and many others homogenisations devs. 

We lost a crazy core idea in dota and the game is poorer for it. But go ahead, make a right click tinker build and pretend the logic of this rearm is making sense.
            Tinker got the Techies treatment
            He has 2.8s cd (2.1 with octarine) on int dagger with 240 int. I think that hero is weak rn but not to 32%wr.

On 6 slots still have 6s cd hex, 4.5s cd dagon, 4.8 windwaker and so on. Not OP as it was but quite broken. But it's just theorycrafting in lobby.
                None of this matters, at 10min, his impact is 100% reliant on blink and soul ring. What he can maybe with 30k gold is totally irrelevant.
                Tell me what the average time of getting 240 int will be?
        If this Tinker had 100% win rate, he still wouldn't be back.


Tinker no longer exists. The same as Brew, Morph, Invoker, and Techies. 


These are new heroes that are shadows of their former selves in the unique way they feel and played.


Just have to move on.
            I don't think Brew and Morph got bad changes that destroyed their identity, unless I'm forgetting something? When was Primal Split ruined? When did Morph lose stat shift?

This change is so mind-bogglingly awful it's like if Primal Split was replaced with an aoe slow or something. Completely different tier of ruined hero.

Edit: Unless they were gutted this patch? I haven't read the entire thing yet.
            Dude i literally won 3 games as techies today, yes the attack range is worse in lane but his kit is still the exact same.
        No it absolutely isnt lmfao. The hero is literally unplayable, his only damage abilith rn is laser, and he cant refresh blink to chase, so he lasers u, afk for 2 seconds, and then has to run after you? Tinkers mobility, utility and damage was removed, for what ? So he can farm with march? Even with items it doesnt matter because he cant refresh anything, so whats the fucking point lol. Tinker used to play for the lvl18 bkb timing, now hes gonna be playing for the 60m 240 int timing, and then hes BARELY passable
            I'm not claiming to have any answers, I'm just saying that maybe they had something in mind for him that we don't know yet because it's literally not been a full day since the biggest patch we have seen in a long time.
        The hero is half nuker/half support with no real identity in between! 
Having boots on him now is a necessity and yet serves no real purpose! Which boots upgrade is viable on him right now? Cause i cant see any!
He can’t nuke anyone with a 300 damage laser! The enemy will casually walk away with 350+ move speed and you’re chasing after them with your 310 ms and no boots after channeling for 2.75 seconds! The nuke potential is not enough.
You heal your teammates and shield them but the heal is negligible and any support with one cc can kill you now cause you lost that 500 damage nuke! Ok i am exaggerating that last part though!
        This. Start taking names on this thread, because at least 5% of the people here will be the ones bitching about Tinker within two letter patches.
    Good.
Thx valve for unplayable hero (again)
    Yeah unironically thank you, fuck that hero
    Removed something unique and special - one of those crazy and cool things you'd tell/show your friends about to try to sell them on the game - yet again. I have no idea why, it's such a shame.
        > one of those crazy and cool things you'd tell/show your friends about to try to sell them on the game

Hey bro. Play dota 2 bro. You can be perma hexed by this hero bro. Trust me bro it's fun. I love being perma hexed
            how's that any different from a snowballing nyx/riki where if you dont hold hands as 5 you instantly die?
                Too many casuals playing this game nowadays. They always ruin good games that have punishing mechanics because its "anti-fun." Happened to Magic the Gathering too.
                    Ah yes, those filthy casuals with real lives and other activities?  They don't deserve to enjoy this video game.
                        I have a real 8-5 job and also prefer to play videogames that are mentally stimulating and sometimes contain what many consider to be "hardcore" mechanics. I don't think "having a life" and "enjoying mental stimulation" are mutually exclusive. I've been playing Dota 2 since 2011 and Dota 1 since around 2008, I still play the game because I love it, but some changes are definitely better than others =)
                            I enjoy dota and am fine with it's hardcore mechanics as well, but outside of work my life is very one dimensional.  Some people are more balanced, and have other hobbies/activities, and just want a more chill experience.

I started playing dota in 2014, back when supports were still poor af and basically treated like dogs.  I've seen harder days than these, although you've probably seen harder I imagine being a dota 1 player.

The difference is I'm not complaining about casuals dumbing my game down after a patch that made the game more complicated.
                                > The difference is I'm not complaining about casuals dumbing my game down after a patch that made the game more complicated.

While continuing to shit on beloved heroes with interesting mechanics. Don't worry, the complexity was ramped up to 11 now that Centaur has a passive that makes him not need to buy boots. Such complexity.
                        Not every game has to be for everyone.
                            That doesn't give you ownership dawg.  Hell things like free wards, everyone gets a free courier that upgrades for free, making roles like support have more stuff so you don't have to be a masochist.  It's not like Valve doesn't have casuals in mind, even though it's in a less casual genre.
                                Who said I own anything?
                                    You're the one out here complaining about casual players in your free video game ruining things.  If you have a problem with the possibility of getting teammates who don't treat this game the same way you do, don't play team games.  That's just the reality, not every teammate wants what you want out of the experience.
                at least with those two they got the courtesy to be simple,quick,and somewhat close to you

with old tinker you can die while the MF spamming missile 1500+ range away or rearming in your face while spamming hex laser missile shiva multiple time
                    also one of the most slipery hero to catch
                        i mean all 3 is slippery in their own way,but yeah tinker can be the most slippery in pubs with player that can play him and the enemy have no coordination or just any way to capture tinker due to bad draft,itemization, tinker just having too much net worth,or all 3 combined
                            Wont say nyx is slipery other than the 60ish second cd invis, riki is quite slippery and tinker is yea one of the most slippery hero esp with defense matrix even if you catch him he can blink away. Adding defense matrix somehow makes tinker way more cancerous
                                youre forgetting carapache,impale strike,and possibly burrow
                I dont think old tinker need to snowball to do this, also at least for nyx/riki they need to snowball esp as core since they are hero farming types that cant really jungle
                    old tinker needed it be 50mins into the game to do that, nyx does that once he hits lvl 7
                        I check, CM level 7 no item dies with 1 round of spell, with tranqui its + 1 ish attack, with tranq + wand became 2ish and with extra raindrop/fluffy hat became 3ish. its CM the hero that dies to gust of winds, doesnt looks broken.
            Who sold dota to a friend with tinker 💀💀
            Nyx night stalker tinker wards shutting tinker down early. But nooo, complaining is easier (: (:
                Naming hero counters when he's generally lastpicked isn't really much of a thing imo
            Okay, so make hex stack diminishingly, same with shivas, or just make them \*unable to be rearmed\*. What is so good about destroying the concept, to rebuild the same concept just worse?
            only happens late game though and smth like lotus orb breaks the combo real good.  
For me the egregious balancing is when they give heroes like that defensive capabilities like Zeus getting jump or Tinker's defence matrix. Another change I'm starting to get suspicious about is allowing heroes to do scaling damage from fog, like khanda pre-nerf, hoodwink (who somehow wasn't nerfed this patch) and that new sniper facet makes his not break fog to attack.
            Shadow shaman stuns for 7-8 seconds without any items or having to press a million buttons. Or he can chain permastun with Octarine. Tinker needed level 18 and at least like 15k net worth before considering it.

Seriously, Tinker didn't even buy hex that often anymore last patch. Without a hero number advantage, sitting there chain hexing a single target while whittling their hp down by 700-800 damage per rearm cycle is just asking to get counterplayed.
                Shaman stuns you at the cost of not being able to move, attack or use any spells. Tinker could hex you INDEFINITELY.
                    >Tinker could hex you INDEFINITELY.

While also blasting you with 600 damage nukes every 1.2 seconds.
                    Shaman can do stuff after hex. Rearm has channeling time. You're ignoring the fact that Tinker needs 18 and like 4 items to even consider permahex.

In the end, words are pointless. You don't play Tinker if you think getting permahexed by a Tinker is a major consideration any time within the past few patches. Link me a single game you've played in the past year where a Tinker on either team chained more than 2 hexes in a row on the same hero if you disagree.
                    Yeah, I don't know what this guy is smoking. Shaman disables one guy, gets jumped on he's fucking dead, a fucking paper hero. Best case you jump with 5 heroes on tinker, with dot, stuns and all that jazz and he still manages to rearm and blink away. 

Fuck tinker, second best day in Dota  , first one being techies murdered
                yeah but shaman wasn't used by every smurf under the sun and actively ruining games.

Tinker could literally solo win games in lower ranks and was a very common smurf hero
                    That sounds like a smurfing problem and not a Tinker problem. Do you think smurfing goes away if Tinker is removed?
                        [deleted]
                            any carry hero can completely control a game when there is a 3k mmr difference, Quinn and Grogc won 1 v 5 with bristleback, using smurfing to justify killing a heroes identify is stupid.
                                Don't care, glad Tinker is dead
                    Just wait in the coming weeks nightmare abomination builds are going to be discovered by smurfs and it’s gonna be even crazier than old tinker
                No fucking way you are trying to tell people playing against shaman is worse than tinker or that he has more CCs. Tinker could do it infinitely while no stopping blinking and having a pitstop at the fountain when needed lol
                    If your complaint is that getting chain stunned is unfun, then yes, you should be more concerned with heroes like Lion or Shaman.

Prior to yesterday's patch, Tinker was already rarely played. When he's played he rarely goes hex. When he goes hex it's usually very late into the game. When he has hex he rarely gets off more than 1-2 chain hexes either because the target is already dead or there was a counter initiation, not to mention teamfights are chaotic so it's rare to just have a opportunity to chain hex one enemy. Compound all of that, and we're talking about like a lottery winning chance of someone playing a random game of dota and getting chain hexed by a Tinker.

Seriously. When was the last time you were chain hexed by a Tinker? I asked 3 people this already and not a single one can mention an actual game.
                        Man I rather Lion and Shaman chain stunning me for 10 minutes than play a game against old tinkers lol. Fuck Tinker, I don't care if he was bad last patch I've seen Tinker in his IMBA days and until this day I hope he gets deleted. Always a good day when you get a patch and tinker get blasted 🙏🏼
        I feel like either they're gonna revert stuff like this, or the hero will get buffed so much to compensate he's gonna be broken

No, if you don't like tinker, changes like this aren't good, because valve will buff it a lot to compensate and then the hero will be actually picked every game

...And for people who don't like tinker, it's a slap in the face to the hero's design for how long it has been
            It's an amazing patch, BUT some heroes got way more love, way cooler changes and buffs,hell, some heroes didn't earn nothing new while others got new passives and extra or new or rework abilities
            hes just gunna have a series of 2-3 failed rework patches until he becomes another brawler hero that is broken OP for a patch

they never revert their reworks, not really. medusa going all-in on manashield was simply hard forced by valve until it was broken
                The sad truth, I really hate what they're doing to their unique heroes that play very differently like Tinker, Ember, Techies, etc.
                ...and then they nerfed it a bit, and now medusa is in a totally fine place

(or at least she was before this most recent patch)
                Clinkz, Riki, OD?
            I feel like they need to make the innate more powerful to bring a shadow of that older playstyle back.
            Tinker haters are cheering but he got his march of the machines back and it seems people have forgotten how fucked that skill is and tinker having like 30% wr means it will get overbuffed out of the wazoo.
            They can buff him all they want but I hope they keep the item cd stuff. Make him viable in other ways, getting perma hexed in the lategame just feels horrible.
                When was the last time you got permahexed? Can you please link a game?
                    Of course he can't, it happened months (if not years) ago because no one actually picks Tinker, there's a really simple solution to not get permahexed by Tinker, actually play the game before you're 6-slotted, people acting like other carries don't exist and Tinker is the only hero who is a menace late game are self-reporting on their skill.
            > gonna revert stuff like this

I highly doubt it, it seems in recent years Valve are really set in their ways on making things that are too different more brawl-focused and homogeneous (which is heavily playing against dota's strengths imo).

What they *should've* done is **reverted** their nerfs to Rearm, it should've never been given a cooldown to begin with. Instead they sextupled down on this dumb choice. I don't see this mistake ever being corrected, sadly.
            Just add that it refreshes dagger, and the other items it lowers cooldown. And it's playable while not beeing cnacer.
            they arent that incompetent  
the hero was fucking annoying to play against, much like techies
                t. nyx flair
                    ehe
                    At least against nyx a lot of the time I go "hm, well I feel like I should've seen that coming". Vs tinker I see it coming a mile away and I still just die. No matter where you go, he's there.
            Honestly? I hate playing with Tinker deeply, but now that his ultimate no longer breaks the game in half, I'm actually eager to see what he can do with reasonable version of Rearm, now that Valve has the leeway to buff him without everyone and their mother screaming bloody murder whenever a semblance of something seeming like a buff comes Tinker's way.

So yeah. Buff Tinker all the way. The annoying part of the hero is gone, the one that made everyone howl in those... what was it? 8-9 months Tinker was actually strong, not a Smurf/Cheeky last pick/Spammer hero, and left such a deep emotional trauma on everyone who had to deal with this bullshit, that they still can't look at Tinker without uttering something along the lines of "delete this hero".

Having *up to* 60% CDR on items is still strong as hell (Good Juju Dazzle says "hi".), and Tinker still uses active items **way** better than almost any hero in the game currently. That's solid foundation as any to build both new builds and new balance patches from.

The hero now may be actually good, but not make everyone want to rip their hair out.  
  
Except a few elitists thinking that them having all the fun in the game at expense of 5 to 9 (hello, old Tinker with Marches taking up ALL farm on the map) other players is completely normal and everyone who says otherwise is a crybaby who just can't git gud.  
  
It is a shame about the distinctiveness, really, but it was nigh unbalancable and unhealthy and had to go. Tinker was either out there, causing generational trauma to Dota players, or was borderline unusable if you weren't spamming him, no in-between.
                Problem is the hero is downright terrible. Say hello to like 70 base damage Tinker or like 1 seconds channel on rearm to make him viable. Or march maybe is endless spamming
                T. Crybaby
        LOL tinker is reason why people leave dota. Noob stumper abused by smurfs, trash in pro play.
            I am one of them quit dota coz mf exists
            Very casual player here who doesn't do ranked and bounces between other MOBAs, can confirm every game with a Tinker gets me closer to take another break. His skill ceiling to stupidly high when playing against noobs, to the point if feels like playing CS against a spinbotter.

Literally my last game 2 days ago I had a Tinker carry my team, and yet it was *still* annoying to play because he made the lanes unusable by nuking everything and leaving before anyone even thinks about pushing. After 20 minutes everyone might as well just sit in fountain and let him do his bullshit. So fun.
                Oh wow, I think I maybe had one tinker on my team that carried me, everything else is cancer smurf on the other team.

Accidentally I had a russian tinker 2 days ago offlane first item travel boots, and then he was spamming NON-STACKING march.

gg throw
        Techies players - "WE WARNED YA. WE TOLD YA YOU'LL BE NEXT! BUT. YOU. DIDN'T. LISTEN."

Now enjoy your crippled hero. Have fun with your own "taser" - just wait for 2 years till it becomes somehwat viable skill to use.
            another casualty of war from shitty players that dont want to learn how to counter certain niche picks
            Oh also, just want to say this since I've never told anyone outside of my friend group: One of my friends when he was new to dota got a rampage/ultra kill on Techies *after* an 'afk' abandon on his first game of Techies. Hilarious time.
            I also disagreed with them changing Techies. Idiots get frustrated by things that punish idiocy and want it gone, removing cool and dramatically different stuff from the game. It sucks.

Meanwhile they give Sniper the ability to attack without revealing himself, which is going to stomp morons harder than Tinker ever did while requiring 1% of the effort. Wow, Valve.
        Tinker was always a reason to stay away from the game.
        great argument, they could also develop a hero where he kicks u in the balls everytime u auto attack thats unique and special too too
        > I have no idea why

Because it felt absolutely hopeless to play versus a good Tinker and he didn't need very much team support either. It's a balance of fun: If one person out of ten has all the fun and the others have none then it's not a good concept, even if it's "unique and special".
            This only really applies to incompetent and/or 0 communication/teamwork teams. Everybody else has a game of cat and mouse where the frustration of Tinker slipping away is counterbalanced by the rush of catching him.
            Link me the last game you played where you got stomped by a tinker
    we don't need that kind of cancer in the game. oftentimes, it is impossible to kill that hero, especially when the guy uses key bindings
    Nothing of value was lost. Git gud scrub. /s
    Waaaah my favourite hero isn't insanely broken anymore. Welcome to the club, kid.
        2k player detected
            Obviously. Hating on tinker is literally saying "I am low mmr and I blame smurfs when I lose games"
        there wasn't even a 1 week period in the entire dota history where tinker was broken
            was there even a single day?
            Ok lol. I don't care what the maths or Purge says, the guy is broken. The idea that a hero can TP around the map and spam abilities like it's WTF mode is broken.
                nerf Riki I can't see him
                    Nice try but everyone buying dust is a lot easier to counter than scythe, euls, rod/gleipnir, keeping the edges of the map warded and hoping your mid doesn't get destroyed so he doesn't have an 11 minute blink
                >I don't care what the facts say, the Earth is flat and that's final
                    Yeah because that's a totally rational comparison. What makes you think he wasn't broken? This isn't a "the sky is blue, water is wet" situation. Dota is open to interpretation and debate, what is considered OP one day isn't the next when trends change. 

If the majority of people are rejoicing that he's been nerfed into the ground, that says that he was busted and nobody enjoyed playing against him, regardless of if YOU, an intellectual, much better than us mere mortals, thinks he wasn't and was easy to beat.

TL;DR, the game isn't designed for 9k+ players, it's designed for the masses, the average. If the average player was struggling against him, he was broken.
        You are ogre magi if you think 35% winrate is "isn't insanely broken anymore"
32% WR LMAO
As much as I'd like to say "fuck tinker", the change makes no sense. Tf is he supposed to do in a fight? March????? He certainly cannot laser blink laser anymore.
I swear someone at Valve just personally hates this hero, I don't know how else you can think of trashing an already trash hero more.
    Someone?
    Someone at Valve? Most people hate the hero. There hasn't been a point in the game where the general public was excited to see Tinker in their matches, and this includes Dota 1.
        is this shit techies all over again, old techies is absolutely hated.
        The only players who hated Tinker are the new players who started playing in the last decade.
        And those people cant do shit. It is not about how much people cry on reddit, it is about balancing the hero from the devs, which they did not with a 32% winrate hero.
            This is one of the most game-changing patches Dota has had... ever. Things are obviously not going to be perfectly balanced on day 1, especially when literally every single hero got touched. Give it a bit of time.
                Honestly the tinker change has nothing with time that valve needs. Tinker doesn't buy boots and he is just a glass cannon with a low mana pool and an insanely shitty caste range. Tinker needed blink and soul ring to even function and they took that away. Tinker dropped from a 48% win rate to 32% over night and once people figure out the patch he will drop even lower then 30% which would be a first in dotas history.

The rework is just insanely bad designed and the person who worked on it has basically no idea how the heroes works in game.
                How is it the most game changing patch? It literally changes nothing but removes glyph and reworks to roshan banner. Every hero getting buffed across the board (apart tinker) is not "most game changing"
            Not easy to balance a hero with a refresher orb ult. I expect Tinker to be reworked, simular to Techies level.
                Just make sheepstick not get refreshed like bkb or some shit! Even then there’s ways around to play against a tinker! Most players won’t do it cause they would rather delete the hero entirely  than buy a euls or lotus to counter tinker!
A lot of these players choose not to itemize against a possible irritating hero thats gonna laser you from the fog and get tunnel visioned in buying more damage item for their hero instead!
                    > Just make sheepstick not get refreshed like bkb or some shit!

There were already soo many items Tinker were not able to get refresed from his ult, soo why bother making him refresh items at all? Oh wait.
                        If you’re gonna make his ult refresh just his spells and not his items then we need to see some overhaul in his spells cause the tinker right now is a complete mess!
Either return his ult to what it was or dont give him any defensive spell like defense mechanism!
He’s gonna be a sitting duck with that gone!
                            yeah probably,the change on some hero feels very rushed(tinker included),so i expect it to be better in the coming week/month
                    I feel like the thing tinker players aren't ready to hear is that travels/tp are the item that needs to not get refreshed. I don't think the hero is balanceable when you can play literally the entire map.
    Actually whoever balances the game now just tries to appease reddit. Nobody here's going to complain about Tinker being unplayable.

All it takes to make reddit happy is more power creep as long as it's "meme-worthy".

I'm personally looking forward to 7.40 where every hero has a slow/CC, scales infinitely and has 3 mobillity spells and 2 waveclear spells
        Power creep is an inevitability as it's effectively required to keep making new and interesting changes, this is a problem 100X worse than power creep imo, completely gutting hero identity - especially of heroes that are *very* unique in identity.
    How was a hero with one of the highest winrates of midlaners on immortal rank a trash hero?
    fcking everyone hates this hero and no its not because of smurf i rather lose to ember spirit or anti mage smurf or so then against fcking tinker
        With that mindset you'll lose to anything.
            Except tinker
    finally dead hero so happy

Look at how they crippled my boy :(
This is what you get when one of those Reddit posters redesign a hero.  One of the most unique and fun heroes is ruined. 
I just hope they reverse it at some point. 
Another unique hero gutted and homogenized because of Reddit crying.
    really reddit is the reason? lol
        Outside the 1% of the herald player base that visit reddit, no one complains about Tinker.
        Reddit is icefrog.
    If they put up a survey in game about "How do you feel about Tinker" I don't think many people would be fond of "wow I love seeing this dude in my games as a 5th pick on the enemy team". Its the same as Techies. Great that it had an identity, but its nice when I look at it from the rear view mirror and not in the backseat of my car.

Like Doom can only be the "walk at you and right click guy, everything in the game he can do is in service of walking at people and hitting them with autos" because Devour/GPM and Doom are his entire kit. The various versions of Scorched Earth, the old LVL Death, and now Infernal Blade are all just things that make him do kinda nothing but running at people.  

Unique identities are fine and all, but also at some point it stops them from doing anything with the character when it would be too good with the existing stuff.
        He probably got deleted because 90% of players added him to that new ban list.
    More like "because icefrog is no longer balancing this game"
        isnt it rumored that Icefrog is returning to DOTA2 full time after being mostly done with the Smite-like game Valve is developing some month ago?
            I hope so. It's him that made Dota good in the first place!
                In 2 years Icefrog will be looking for ideas to implement for a patch and he'll look at Tinker and go "wait wtf happened to Rearm???" before immediately changing back.

A man can dream.
            Haven't heard about the frog returning, do you have any more info on that?
                its mostly just rumor that come from datamine and anonymous source that kinda line up with whats happening with the new game so unfortunately no,but some quick goole maybe can answer it
                    No worries, just hadn't heard anything and wanted to know if you knew more info. Not trying to second guess you!
    If all the uniqueness comes down to abusing the ladder for one person at cost of every other player's suffering, then this uniqueness ain't worth shit.
        why do all people cry if in this patch tinker has 49% winrate and 4% pick rate?
            That doesn't include low MMR and smurfs. On top of that it was only a setback, he could easily make a comeback like he always does.
                on MMR lower than 2k tinker winrate was 47%)
Techies, now Tinker. Who's next? To hell with it, make it all League.
    I guess Icefrog will just have to settle for curing cancer IRL after this.
    As much as I really enjoy some changes, this is sadly what it will become within a few more years. So many heroes already feel soo similar and boring.

Like YES give me that awersome ss-innate making him a chicken thats cool.

but maybe DONT also nerf every single hero that isnt a boring fucking rightclicker and nothing else ...
    Timber, because it starts with T too
        Yes actually. This is how this works sadly. 

Smurfs WILL find a hero to abuse. Removing a hero from the game such as tinker will not fix this issue.

I assume people are probably gonna complain about Chen , meepo or Invoker next. Its gonna be interesting to see.
    Tark Warden
    Techies is a million times more fun to play & play against, and is much more reliable as a hero. Let's wait a bit and see what actually happens to Tinker.

Sure, it sucks for the 1% of players who like current Tinker, but the other 99% of players will love this change.
        it feels so weird seeing people absolutely hated old tinker and techies then see complete 180 when it got change. I havent see threads loving those heroes until they got gutted then it reach front page with people being sad about it
            Maybe because they were too busy enjoying it? Have you heard of the concept of the silent majority?
            idk are you expecting constant "tinker appreciation threads" or something? if you play a hero like tinker or arc warden every single 3k andy in this subreddit wants you dead so people dont really talk about it. tinker especially was just kind of a trash hero for the last year so even people who really like him werent playing him much. I love tinker but i literally haven't played him in a pub in over 3 years
        >Techies is a million times more fun to play & play against

Lmao
    pls remove arc too
Thank god, get fucked Tinker. There's never been an era in DotA where Tinker was good and the game was fun.
    > There's never been an era in DotA where Tinker was good 

Correct
        Nah, pre-6.60 Tinker was a contestant for strongest hero in the game. After 6.60 bkb rearm nerf he just became a strong hero with some ramp time, and then march being removed kinda made him a complete feast or famine hero.
        There was that patch after the mini-rework with aoe laser and keen conveyance that he was mega OP for a while
    Tinker sits in that group of heroes alongside Brood and Arc Warden where I’m frankly unconcerned if they’re not especially viable 
        Imo Brood is good rn in these terms. Not nearly as annoying as she was before
        Brood has been a mafighter hero for like 4 years now, and no one bitches about it, much less actual Brood players who just do what she already did (gobbling up entire jungles and murdering lone supports, consuming a ton of space) except for splitpush (the cancerous playstyle). So basically, directly opposed to the AFK bad Techies players who loved Remote Mines and cry and bitch daily. They want cancer techies back because it's all they knew, getting a kill 8 minutes later entirely off the vback off luck because the game state changed twice gave them the only dopamine they knew - while the good techies players who were hyper aggressive and even built sign right on enemy Tier 3's didn't give a fuck.
        Jeez calm down there mate! Frankly unconcerned?! That's pretty aggressive talk.
    I agree, in a patch where the typical mid hero (ember,lina,void,storm even sometimes meepo) has low winrate and practically missing in pro scene i sometimes wish they got a buff.
But never tinker, and now that rearm no longer refresh item that hero has become "normal" thank god.

P.S : Condolences to tinker player at least now you understand how i feels

Sincerely, techies player
        Yeah, now they know how WE felt when they massacred our boys!
deserved for playing tinker
Knowing it's frog they probably gonna give a shard or a basic skill to repositioning tinker like blink dagger in next  next patch so enjoy death tinker for a while.
A lot of heroes have some placeholder reworks atm like the guys that get a current passive as their innate. Tinker is in this same bucket and will likely continue to be tweaked to a healthier and healthier design as time goes on.
[32% winrate](https://tenor.com/view/stop-already-dead-kristen-msm-jokes-over-burger-gif-15769364) haha
I swear this hero needs a rework
    This was his rework.
sips wine  
proceed to beat him up with my homies
Took my 46% winrate hero and removed him from the game. 

Lone druid and Tinker after being dead for over 6 months both getting nerfed for no reason. Wtf is wrong with valve
    Tinker dead hero ?
You haven’t seen him in smurf games or turbo games where he obliterates everyone with unlimited hex shiva
        Just because a hero destroys in your 2k bracket doesnt mean its broken. A smurf can pick anything and still win, dota shouldnt be balanced around what noobs are getting smurfed on by(or turbo lol).The hero was unpicked in pro since TI, that alone means hes deserving of a buff. Not even mentioning the plethora of other issues the hero had. I.E, his terrible winrate.
            Not picked in TI doesn’t mean he’s weak hero in general just doesn’t fit with the current meta and gameplay direction especially since pros play on a different level with different perspectives. 
And no I’m not in 2k bracket but thanks for the assumption
                Tinker WAS picked in TI, I said he hasnt been picked since. If the hero was good, he wouldnt have gone unpicked in tier1 for 8 months(worth noting hes the only hero thats been unpicked in pro since TI). He also wouldnt have a 46% winrate across all brackets. And if you’re above 2k and still are unable to figure out how to kill a Tinker, you might need to stop playing Dota.
                    Good I hope we never see him again!
Okay I will stop playing dota lol
It could only get better if they removed the hero
Might as well nerf and remove all the other high skill cheese heroes Valve. Arc warden, invoker, techies, meepo, etc. Just keep heroes like sniper, anti mage and phantom assassin. Tinker isn’t even OP and even has a weak early game. Noobs crying cuz they don’t know how to deal with tinker. 
    Techies isn’t high skill anymore, especially since the rework. I just lost to the Attack Speed = Attack Range gimmick, we couldn’t do anything to them also fearing FV’s Chrono.

He got buildings for free.
У гейба мать шлюха
    пойдем блять трахнем его маму
thank god that wretched hero is dead.
Holy patch!
So, role change. Nice
Well... tinker has to walk or tp now.
Good riddance
My legs are broken,

the kneecaps are stolen
It is from Kaccel: [https://www.youtube.com/@KaccelTinker](https://www.youtube.com/@KaccelTinker)  
And it is not that new.
Support tinker with lowered CD and wave clear incoming.
I don't get the tinker hate, the hero is barely ever played.. and most of the time isn't hard to deal with.
    People just don’t know how to deal with tinker. So they cry on Reddit. “Tinker is broken guys”
KACCEL TINKER!!!
Honestly, the best update so far. 
Guys talking about how tinker is so easily countered by wards and nyx or stalker and how he’s not picked at all by higher brackets. 

The only tinker experienced by most of the players is that guy with 20+ win streak tinker spammer who plays on low-med brackets with fast blink shiva. It wouldn’t be this update if people didn’t use this hero just for boosting against clueless players.
The biggest L is I got an immortal for that creep of a hero from candy shop treasure and I don’t even play the hero + he got nerfed 🥲
Fuck tinker and fuck old techies, actually enjoy playing techies and even versus the hero after change. This was needed, nerfs the smurfs and the stale HG meta.
I'm glad he's dead
Good. I Hate this hero more than old techies.
Gooood...
Fuck tinker
Awww, I can't be in my bubble 24/7 just fucking rearming and blinking out of every situation. Fuck off
Tinker and arc warden players get no sympathy. Fuck tinker they should nerf him even more. Make him take 200% more damage from pos4 and 5
I feel nothing for tinker players
wait so how are you supposed to play him now?

his new kit is kinda good for team fights, but I can't see him running mid anymore; pos4/3? what items to buy?
    That's the neat part, you don't
    if *anything at all*, maybe a 4. I'm trying to think about an aetherlens mek memehammer build for sustain push but its basically just a cringier version of pugna or dazzle that needs more items

dazzle and tinker infact are extremely similar mechanically now, both used to have their ults affect item CDs but now its only abilities, but dazzle has better basic abilities imo and rearm is way worse than bad juju
    Its not even good for a team fight lmao!
You need to be in the middle of a fight to get a good march! And he needs like 3 items to be even a viable nuker! Blink is without a doubt still a no brainer unless you decide to get a phase boots or some shit for ms! Definitely not a pos 3 as he can’t initiate, cc or tank any damage! Maybe a 4 but he still has no catch, chase or escape! He’s got a measly unreliable heal and a 650 range nuke that’s riskier to hit cause you cant really run away from any hero now!
Now i guess tinker can only be a support right?
    Yeah or pos 3. It's moving there for some time now, they started by buffing the defense matrix. 450 all damage barrier that you can reapply is not that bad actually. You can build him into greaves + solar and just be a traveling medic, shifting from burst core hero to more of a support/healer role.
that's sooo perfect & all the crybaby spammers making this so much better
Hero got his best spell back and got unshackled from only one viable build. Is he same as he used to be? No but thats good thing.
    Reddit moment lol
Fuck that hero. Hope to never see it again.
I won with a tinker yesterday, he rushed arcane blink, he seemed strong enough, he didn’t depend on rearm for survivability because items had 0 cd regardless
