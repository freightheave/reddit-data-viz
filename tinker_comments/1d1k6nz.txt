Force Staff and similar abilities can no longer be used on Leashed targets

WTF
    it was there when the patch came, but wasnt documented D:
        Yeah, we had people calling it a bug.

I wish it was a bug, holy medaroli, I haven't feared a slark in years, now I might.
            Sounds like eul time
                Every patch is a good patch for a Windwanker patch!
                I'm currently relearning the game. Would you euls Slark, or the victim? Would eulsing the victim break the leash after the euls duration?
                    you cannot euls a teammate, not until you have windwaker. Eulsing the slark is also not reliable because he has the purge.

So it’s mostly for the one buying euls. It’s that or ghost scepter
            Slark was meant to be a supports hunter, for quite some time u guys have been running free ...
                True, but now i think his Aghs is too strong. The 2 charges where balanced around people forcing away from the first one. Now there is no counterplay against the 2 charges
                    the counter play is being in a low enough bracket that the slark simply whiffs the second pounce
                    Exactly and one way for slark to die is bait his w and support force you out now what everyone just run like headless chicken in a losing game
            Uh, he has like 40% win rate right now so idk, maybe sometime in the future? 
            Well, they shouldn't call it FORCE staff anymore
                CONSENT Staff when?
        I remember going crazy one game thinking I was doing something wrong because force staff just didn’t work
        Ohhhh this is why I wasn't able to force out of slark's pounce 2 days ago ???
        My friends always called me stupid, when I bought euls instead of force. I guess who is laughing now! huh?
    Slark Stonks! 🚀🌕
        And barracuda got buffed a bit for laning, and the innate is still mid, but slark is slowly becoming harder to zone during laning phase, due to him just hiding a bit and regenerating.  Since its still mid, Icefrog will continue buffing it until broken territory
            Yeah regeneration during entire lane, rather than starting lvl 6 when lane is largely decided, is very nice. Plus early ward detection
                Support slark incoming. 

Deward everything 

Leash folks

Shroud for team

-25mmr
                    Lmao
                    -500 behav 

+1 single draft
                    As a man that's been trying to push support troll, I'm in
    Why are they making the Leashed status stronger and stronger
        new void ult probably
            I think they made the change to force staff specifically to buff time zone, which is odd; why not just buff the ability itself if it sucks?
                Maybe they want to nerf supports after support power creep so they thought going after force staff would be a start

Idk I'm a support player and I'm saddened by this change

But whatever WE BALL
                    Support players in my rank buy Midas, scepter, gleipnir, bloodthorn. 

What is forcestaff. We have never heard of this item. 

Similarly the cores in my rank have never heard of Bkb.
                        Check enemy team supports, they probably double it to compensate yours :D
                    U supports seriously need some nerfs. 

Look how dog shit Agility cores are right now just because we get kited so hard by u guys.
                Can’t force staff people out of chrono,they could’ve just made it so you can’t specifically force out of time zone as well.
                Time Zone works better if you're a Pos 3 Void with a ranged carry who loves attack speed, and supports who can restrain them inside the Time Zone.

Agh's helps you time lock stun them to drop down the Time Zone ult.

It's like giving the ranged carry a free morbid mask. For the enemy ranged carry it's like a free Shiva's that slows their attack speed and attack projectiles.

It's a bit of a niche facet that works in specific circumstances
        I mean, it's been a joke for years.
            They brought it in along with Grim when you could simply blink out of leashes. They also made it so that you couldn't force out of it iirc but reverted it, from whence it's been a joke
    Ghost Scepter every supp game vs Slark

And Refresher for Ghost Scepter when Slark has Aghs, naturally
        >buy ghost scepter against slark

>carry gets jumped

>noob support no wards no force staff, greedy ghost scepter noob report

>DESPAIR
            Ahh another item I can reserve purely for myself and my survival and carry can fend for themselves
    then how do u get out of pounce?
        Bkb and Windwaker only now

GG

Edit: Pike pushback still works
            Pike support meta 😎
                Finally I can rush blink ags without idiot cores asking me to buy force staff
        It's not just slark, how the fuck do we escape Sprout past level 20 now? I swear quelling blade is finnicky and targets stupid overlapping trees way too often.

Harpoon? Wew can't wait for that report.
            > how the fuck do we escape Sprout past level 20 now?

I don't think devs think changes through sometimes
                They definitely don’t test all their changes. There’s no way they tested the legion changes, tinker changes, that Earth spirit facet, etc
                    I'm sure they try but with how many interactions there are there combined with limited manpower the testing just isn't gonna be very robust at all. I imagine they are doing stuff like testing to see if new abilities even work at all and don't instantly crash but who knows how much past that super basic checking they can manage.
                    WE are the testers
                    ES right facet is such a meme. Like WHY? be crippled in team fights and ganks to be able to what, roll using a stone every time? amazing
                        Stuff like that and the tinker changes made me slightly concerned that whoever is balancing the game now doesn’t know how some of the heroes work lol
            Thank Gaben, I used to think I was the only slow moron who found it so difficult to get out of sprout coz QB sucks.

It always reminded me of trying to click on BH or Tree in Dota1, you had to get it in that sweet spot and JUST Right else it was fiddly af.
            Has anyone try this sprout talent? Because the leash was unique before, it never stop you from walk away from the aoe, only from using mobility spells.
            Yeah I love having to juggle a quelling blade in my inventory like 40+ min into the game. It's not enough with smokes, wards, dust etc. Force staff was nice that way, this is a huge nerf.
        harpoon also :)
        you can still bkb, euls, ghost sceptre, etc. to survive pounce. if slark hits pounce on a support, nullifiers them and has bkb / ult running the support shouldn't be able to get away from that
    This was just an undocumented change from 7.36 I believe. Didn't test with all leashes, but you already couldn't do it from time zone/ pounce
        I don't know about Slark, but as for Time Zone, yeah, my friend played Void support the other day. I already warned him about Force Staff and stuff but it turned out the opponent couldn't use it at all. I thought it was a mechanic tied specifically to that skill or something
            Lame. They should make FS still work in Time Zone but you are just shoved forwards really slowly.
    That sounds like a terrible change to me
    Bruh guess I'll die
    If NP has level 20 leash talent you are just stuck there lmao
        If clock still had the leash talent id be spamming him lol
    As a support only player this is not fun to read at all, think this will get changed in the future or at least changed in some way.

Seems way too harsh.
    Does it stop movement and enemies leash range then? Or just not work? Because the only logical thing would be for force staff to not break the leash, but still push the leashed target, but also the one who used leash.  
I have a degree in using leashes pls valve do it. (Could be Slark nerf, who knows I ain't a scholar)
        I just tested it in demo mode. You can't use forcestaff at all but pike pushback still works
            Pike self cast works?
                Nope
    They did this just to buff the new chrono (whatever it is called). Could've just buffed that instead. RIP supports against slark
        Dang bro u got icefrog all figured out
    Damn it! Holy shit.
    No wonder it didnt work. But this is logically sounds for me.
    Cool, slark kills me as a support all the time. RIP
    Thank fuck, supports actually killable again without having to buy nullifier as a 40k NW core to have a chance at killing the 11K NW Support you jumped
    Now the real cooking can begin. This is the start of the real patch imo.  Looking at how many things werent working as intended (sometimes not at all), it was kinda disappointing to hop into a game only to find that the build you were cooking up was a lot weaker than expected, and many people prolly didnt even realize there were bugs and just dropped it to go for something more traditionalo and boring.
    They really want that void ult work huh
    I think it's a buff to time zone indirectly buffing slark and some others.
    Wait so puck can't force out her own leashed target then either? Malr1ne is going to be sad.
    WHAT THE FUCK ICE FRAUD?!?!??!
> Fixed Clinkz Skeleton Archers also applying Burning Barrage when cast

Rip to mr skele. Was fun while it lasted
    Wait that was a bug? Lmao...well I abused the shit out of that one. I thought it was just really imbalanced.
        Yeah, I'm not actually sure. I thought it might be at first because the damage output for it is *ridiculous*, but it STILL shows in game on the burning barrage tooltip "Clinkz and all his Skeleton Archers in range..."
            Yeah, it’s not a bug, it literally says it’s supposed to do it in the description. They just didn’t understand how OP it would be, and got rid of it as if it were a bug. But yeah they left the phrasing in the description lmao
                I believe the tooltip said that before 7.36 anyways, which I guess would also be a bug
                    it didn't. it looks like they added it but it's way too "strong"... gained a massive 2% win rate and they haven't thought that they could just reduce it to be 50%/40%/30% of the original dmg so they just deleted it.... very "smart" - volvo way of balancing.  
i bet they will return it back with adjustments as I've mentioned in the next micro fix. otherwise, clinkz goes 46% win rate RIP + F
                    nah it didn't i checked it when it first rolled out
                I'm pretty sure it was something they tested internally and forgot to remove before the patch. The patch notes don't mention it and it's comically overpowered. I've never played clinkz in my life, didn't even bother reading what his abilities do, and once I got shard I just walked around killing everyone for free.
        Duh? It was 22.5 AoE attacks of damage in 2 seconds, up from 4.5.
            The barrages from the skeletons actually used the skeleton's attack damage and not Clinkz's. So it was generally closer to like 12 - 15 AoE attacks instead of 4.5, not 22.5, still completely broken though of course.
        And still gg lost with it xd
    That was not intentional?
        It looked intentional.
            Was that intentional? It looked intentional.

    It was kinda cool looking though ,maybe they will bring it back with reduced numbers
    Although, shard description still mentions that they all supposed to cast it
    I didnt even know this was a bug lol, Ive been spamming clinkz for 20+ games now and have good results. I wonder how this change will affect my streak tho
        It’s a big damage change because you could just tear apart any towers. It was a shit load of extra damage, think my game with clinkz yesterday I did 93k damage where the second best on my team was 35k damage.
            Huh? Burning Barrage is the shard, it did no tower damage. This change doesn't affect his ability to take down towers really quickly with skeleton archers and strafe
                Sorry I was trying to say that strafe was broken and same with barrage . The damage output was just insane
        MY BOYYY https://imgur.com/a/060cNTR 😭😭😭😭😭
    using this in pro play recently was like reliving navi's fountain hook
Casually smacking Batrider with one of the biggest nerfs of his life (Sticky Napalm no longer grants vision)
    First they took our flying vision, then they take our daytime vision, and now they take our napalm vision. What’s next? Batrider must use echolocation to see enemies???
        Let him cook... 

Nah for real an echolocation ability could be sick AF
            Make it possible he can detect invisible units when using echolocation.
                I feel like a whole hero based around echolocation would actually be awesome lol, like maybe they have only a tiny fraction of the normal vision range of a hero, but they have an innate where they can send out pulses to locate units much further away than normal vision range until the pulse hits a solid obstacle like high ground, and the pulse sees invisible units up to some distance within that.

Make it an assassin-type agility hero with a gap close / jump and something that makes the target unable to see anything including ally vision like smokescreen, so their vision becomes even worse than yours outside of your innate.
                    Or a lawyer like intelligent hero during daytime
                        I was thinking the hero design would be some sort of bloodsucking creature. Great minds think alike!
                        And hes an expert martial artist?
                            But what's his relationship with women like?
                        A catholic lawyer specifically
                    You're dead-ass describing 3/4 of a League kit right there lol
                    That sounds a lot like how Rek'sai works on league, its an incredibly fun champ and I would like something like her on Dota
            This has so much potential for a mechanic in the game against invis.  This is sick
            Ok, I'd like to see that. Reduce his base vision/fog to 100 around him BUT he has true sight of all units within 1000 units (maybe more or can be increased).

He is blind to most of the map that isn't near him, but can see heroes in his true sigh range and trees maybe?
        On-brand I suppose.
        Well, good idea for innate ability. No normal vision, but see all moving/attacking targets even when invisible.
        New Batrider Facet:

Batrider Rider

Batrider no longer uses eyes to see, but the bat is skilled enough.
Batrider has unlimited vision but can't see anything beyond any collision (tree/cliff/creeps/wards). Fog of War behind any of it. Cannot share their vision with anyone. Cannot use anyone other's vision.
        Like grant him an ability to have vision on enemies that uses a skill in a wide area near him?
        >The player playing Batrider must now continuously scream high pitched noises into their microphone to locate enemies by echolocation.
    Nothing will ever hit harder than his -10 base damage nerf post ti3  back in the day though, only comparable nerf was -14 base from naga and that hoe was still OP
    isn't it par for the course for him at this point? every time he gets buffed into relevancy he's hit with a giga-nerf immediately after
        Bat has been relevant for months before the patch, he was broken these past few days. He's still very strong.
    Bat wasnt even at +50% Winrate...

He reached 45% and they smack him down...

Remember not to long ago he also used to have flying vision while fireflying.

Vission is such an important aspect of Bat and they took it all away...
The batrider cycle continues, they tweak some damage values between firefly and mud every major patch and straight up nerf him in every letter patch following afterwards.
    Bat is probably a contender alongside DS for one of the most nerfed heroes ever in this game.

CM and Pango might soon challenge them if Icefrog keeps mini-nerfing them. Though thankfully Pango had a slight buff this patch.
        Pango got some love because he finally fell into being a sub 45% win rate hero in pro games despite being early picked by bad teams still lol
        Imagine if 2013 Bat was introduced to Dota now. It would seriously be more OP than any other hero in history, legit including bugged versions of heroes. 

There's good reason this hero has been consistently nerfed almost continuously since then.
        Io and naga laugh at the baby nerfs cm and mango have received
        Tonker
        What's about earth spirit?
He was unplayable a lot of years 
    Do you actually play bat? 

You do realize his going to be perma 43% winrate or lower because of pro play right?
>Gyrocopter  
Afterburner rocket barrage movement speed only increased by hitting heroes

Yep, no more zooming grandpa.
    sad, they should have tested giving it the lifesteal treatment: "effect reduced by 40% on creeps" etc.
        Creeps just refreshing would be fine. Now I feel like it can be annoying against zoo heroes.
        It's still strong imo
    I think it’s pretty op still. As support at least since he can dominate the jungle
    When gyro got lvl 3 on lane it was actually just over.I’m glad they did this.
    Damn. Guess they should just make the facet work on Shard Missile's Rocket Barrage.
    My sadness is immeasurable.
Earth spirit 2nd facet still unusable. Spawning a stone at the end of the roll makes roll-> kick back into team impossible due to the targeting prioritizing rocks even if you unit target.
    Yep. I don't think they play enough Earth Spirit on the dev team :(
        honestly sounds like they dont play the hero at all. should be a free boulder placed before every move is used
    They just need to give it hitting a hero with rolling boulder instantly regens a stone...
        Or hitting gives an extra charge of remnant for a few seconds
    Is the first one good? I looked at winrate, and seems ES has gone down quite a bit. But maybe that's because new players try 2nd facet? Was looking to learn a more complex support hero.
        first facet is basically pre 7.36 earthspirit + u get bonus rightclick dmg on cast, giving u a bigger powerspike at lvl 6. Having 5+ stone charges ready at the start of the fight gives you lots of flexibility and is generally 'easier to use' with no real downside. Plus bonus rightclick dmg is no joke early on, solidifiying ES as a midgame powerspike pos4 like tusk, darkseer, marci etc



2nd facet takes away your ability to roll-kick people and the ability to use spam stones, in exchange for guaranteed aoe ult application when you do your roll+ult combo, and immediate E/Q cast after connecting W.


The big thing about 2nd facet is that you dont get forced into the 0.whatever seconds animation lock from summoning stones, meaning enemy teammates (ie supports protecting pos1) have even lesser time to react to your combos. You can conceivably do:



> W+stone (initiation)->ult (magnetize triggering in an aoe because of 2nd facet's remnant summon)->E (which becomes aoe silence due to aoe magnetize debuff). All under ~0.4s because you don't need to weave in remnant casts between each step. 


You also get to activate items earlier because you dont need to commit initial teamfight setup time into casting remnants(as much), and instead can do stuff like w-e-forcestaff out, use mek, or apply urn **before** their supports finish their hex/disables cast animations on you


obvious drawback is that you cant summon 2+ remnants simultaneously at will during teamfights, so if you whiff remnant placements, youre just an idiot squishy pos4 who has basically blinked out of position
    It isn't unusable. That's the tradeoff. I just tried the facet out a couple matches and you really spread magnetize around because of how many stones come out (2 per 4 seconds). 

I think it feels a little wonky, but you spit out so many stones, I think it might have a place.

And I say this as an absolute hater of the facet pre-letter patch.
        I just don't understand how this facet adds anything to Earth Spirit. If it's meant to be an "easy mode" version, you're basically playing a different hero and would need some muscle memory changes if you want to play his other facet. Not only that, the other facet is just a million times better if you can handle ES as he originally played. 

I'd rather they use facets to make certain heroes have different playstyles and give a hero more flexibility. It's the perfect opportunity to make ES support a little better and separate from the core ES players. If they want to add an easy mode, it should be a third facet.
            It's not an easy mode version. It's just a different play style. Honestly, the attack damage during magnetize is boring.
    You could use the dota labs feature to interact with only heroes maybe?
        I thought about just using this dota labs feature too but it doesnt work. Devs dont play earth spirit and apparently they cant code too.
I just hope I can ping my OWN abilities after the patch..    


 It's insufferable that I can ping my level or how much gold i need to complete my item, however I can't ping my TP/BKB/Ult to tell them if it's ready or on cd..


EDIT: You still can't unfortunately 😔 But hopefully more attention is brought to this bug so they can fix it.
    Is that a feature? What the fuck? I'm not able to ping and I thought my behavior score was glitched, because it shows me a message saying my score is too low to ping my own abilities. (I'm able to ping everything else, chat normally etc)
        After the patch hit some weird programming spaghetti happened and now you can't ping your own spells or items and the message you get is: "can't ping allie abilities or items"  


Anyone who is sub 10k behaviour score can't ping allies spells and items . But the bug is confusing you and your allies for some reason.
    You can’t ping runes either if I’m not mistaken.
        Least of my concerns, at this point i communicate telepathicly with my team..
    God that shit is so annoying. How tf is it still not fixed
    no fr, Im almost always in 9.3-9.6k comm score (perfect behaviour) and I never really complained since i am aware 90% of the time I ping an ally ability it would just be a frusterated bro cast that and not add much. 

 So like I genuinely liked not being able to since it stopped me from impulsively doing a frustrated ping flame and potentially tilting a guy (I dont chat flame, or anything else because whenever i write something toxic i usually stop and delete halfway through but pings r just euughh ping).

But like not pinging ults, duel etc. or that I just got bkb/item timing makes communication so hard, Ive started just typing stuff out but like still mid-fight comms are impossible, like I had echo coming off CD in 5 seconds one fight so was waiting in trees mid-fight and couldnt let my team know, we won the fight but two more teammates prob died since they didnt know they didnt need to commit as hard and we'd get the fight win anyway
Great QoL for SK

> Dust Devil Sand Storm now longer gets destroyed if left by Sand King, and keeps following him if he leaves it.
    This is so good! You can now pop it before blinking, then stun, and it will immediately be on top of you
        ...not that this changes much? It's not like you have some massive cast animation on Sand storm; if you have time to stun, you'll most likely have time to cast Sand storm too.
            As a SK player it changes a lot  
Often you've used Sandstorm before a good situation to dagger/epi-combo appears. You often have cooldown on sandstorm and this really helps
                My first thought too - you can (and should) just have permanent sandstorm up all the time.
    Not just QoL but a nice buff, really nice for farming also
        SK farming is top-tier now with the new E anyway.
        For real people need to stop calling functional changes QoL. Just because it's convenient doesn't mean it's QoL. QoL means that the only thing that changes is convenience.
    Now to have it play Darude Sandstorm when cast, similar to Mars' arena. That would be chef's kiss.
        I got a SK taunt that sounds a lot like Sandstorm
    Oh man I thought that was how it originally worked. No wonder SK players have been complaining.
        Previously burrow strike made it recenter on sand king but nothing else.
    Holy hell wtf, that's so good. Now you just cast storm and go wherever without worrying about ending it.
    IT GETS EVEN BETTER!?!?!
    I still think the facet is bait, I honestly believe sand storm not moving (and being 15% bigger and the invis) is better in like 65% of scenarios.
        I think the biggest issue with the moving sandstorm facet is that you can't kill ancient stacks as early as the invis one. There were times where I got bullied out of lane and killed ancients at lvl5 with old Sk, without invis your early to mid game farm can be quite slow compared to invis one.
        seems that way 

https://facets-meta.nyxnyxnyx.com/#ranked___sand%20king___win_rate___desc
            .5% difference

one is bait

uhmm. ok
    yea it made no sense to adjust yourself to the speed of sand storm.

 now i can finally say i like playing sand king hes so good.
Force Staff nerf, wtf
    What I would give to get release Force Staff back. That sweet sweet build up + cast range + push length.
        The 10, 10, 10 force was busted
    I mean it has been THE most imba support item for a LONG time now
    U SUPPORTS HAVE BEEN RUNNING RAMPANT FOR TOO LONG
The earth spirit change is terrible because kick prioritises stones over heroes so you can never kick a hero back
    It should just refresh the cooldown after roll
        2 charges seems fine too. Still maintains the spirit of the facet but answers its most glaring weakness to an extent.
    im an es player and i dont get why any1 would ever choose stepping stone?
        Only reason I can think of is for farming. Before you kinda have to preserve some stones in case a fight breaks out. Stepping stones just lets you use stones willy nilly. Use it to move from camp to camp faster , use your silence to clear faster, use stones to boulder smash hit multiple camps at once.

But yeah like everyone already mentioned, still makes you waaay worse in fighting heroes so its mostly not worth it.
        You can infinitely chain ES ult which is pretty sick in certain long team fights
    First thing I looked at, total bummer because that is the majority of the way I get kills playing as earth spirit. It just needs to be alt-toggleable and I feel like the facet would be really usable. Could maybe even toggle it between the beginning and end of the roll, idk how OP that would be.
    They should add alt-cast on kick to priortize heroes instead
    That’s what I was thinking. Seems like they are clueless on how to fix this hero ffs. Does anyone at valve even know how this hero works?
        the hero doesnt need fixing, the facet is just uninspired
        Nobody on this planet knows how Earth Spirit works.
        I for sure don't.
Additionally, a few Non-gameplay bugs were fixed.

* Fixed Some Crownfall empty dialog lines 
* Fixed Crownfall paths changing their token requirements 
* Fixed Dragon Knight Griffin Knight set having Facet-based coloration swapped 
* Fixed various issues with cloth stretching 
* Fixed watching replays from Broadcaster perspective not displaying heroes 
* Fixed an issue with post-match rewards being delayed 
* Fixed Crownfall Pit Fighter encounter dialog 
* Fixed Crownfall Fishing Spear not being available 
* Fixed Crownfall Graphical issue with Pineapple clickable on Crownfall map 
* Fixed Crownfall Graphical issue with Questing Hearts sign not showing 
* Fixed issue with Act 2's Riki's attribute token being wrong type
    It was funny to see people trying to explain why Riki gave an int token
        Riki players were intellectuals. Not anymore.
        Wasn't there PA or TA in agi also? 
    Ty for being a huge part of keeping Dota alive Sire Wykrhm!
        Whatchu talking about bro? daed gaem since 2003.
            Ty for being a huge part of killing Dota Sire Wykrhm
                You're welcome. 

Funny story. Kids these days might not know but back in the day, we used to play LAN Dota in these places called gaming cafes. Was quite the culture.

So one of my LAN mates always used to say, "bro this mod is good. lets play while we can. generally mods dont get updated when warcraft updates." It was a true fear. Many mods ended up in the grave. So that's how he'd get us to play more Dota games. 

From that perspective, Dota has been fighting death since the dawn of this millennium. AoS did not die. Dota did not die. 

Only our souls died in the process.
                    Can confirm. Am dead inside. Dota is my soul now and makes me feel alive.

(except when I'm matched with dipshits)

Jokes aside, I wish I had the opportunity to play MP games at a net cafe with friends.. we used to play cricket/football outside instead 😞 goddamn sunlight and rain and grass..
                        We did those too. I don't know how the culture was in other countries but in India, doing nights outs as young gamer groups was quite a thing. So the gaming cafe would stay open all night just for our group so we could game all night -- while drinking and having fun -- yeah we got some liberty.

They get the extra income and we get to bond as a group .. well mostly .. not every Dota game leads to bonding as you all are well aware. Mix that with alcohol.. oh boy .. good times. That's all I can say.
                            Learning wykrhm’s backstory more exciting than patch notes ngl
                            Bro.. gaming inside then sutta and chai outside.. all while bunking college classes lol. Dota and CS were life. Golden days I tell you. I wish gaming cafe culture would make a comeback. Unfortunately too old and grumpy for that now.
                                Literally my life 20 years ago.
                                    mine too.. flunked college for this shit ha
                                    Oldies like us should make a song …chai sutta dota. 🤓 those good old days in Hyderabad …we used to play for hours and hours subah se leke raat tak. The gaming cafés is what I miss too. Youngsters these days play from homes and don’t know pub ka mahaul and lan gaming
                            Same culture as back then when I was growing up in the Philippines. Basically play sportsball in high noon up to evening, then after dinner we go to a net cafe owned by a family friend that lets us stay until past midnight.
                            Wait...wykrhm aap Indian ho? Bhai bhai kya baat!
                                My go to GIF when my team sucks: [https://i.imgur.com/Zcc43GD.gif](https://i.imgur.com/Zcc43GD.gif)
                                    Bro. So good to get to know you! Feels human rather than just playing Dota thinking it’s made by anonymous people. But to have someone who we can relate to
                                his name didnt tip you off? :P
                                    Wykrhm is not a name I have heard in India soo no
                            Maybe we should have a India dota meetup, where 5 players can play and rest can do backseating.   
Or better have proper 5v5 in room one game at a time.
                            Best time, I loved it the most when we have enough players for a LAN game. Sometimes we bet on it too, usually just a drink each. At peak, we had like 3 or 4 people on queue, they would prefer to observe and wait for a slot rather than playing online games.  


And then occasionally we would have a night out drinking alcohol, come back to the gaming cafe, play until 3 or 4 in the midnight.

Games we played:  
- LoL  
- Dota   
- Age of Empire 1  
- Pokemon (w3 custom map), 0.5$ (about a drink here) reward on each player slayed
                    The amount of fights I've seen outside of the cafes were hilariously high. Good times
                        Dude, we had a friend who did not take alcohol well. Once we gauged he was past his limit, we would go to great lengths to avoid killing him in the game. The emotional drama that would ensue otherwise was one for shitty Hindi soap operas. On the bright side, was a great buzz killer before we had to go home.
                            Lol yeah we had one dude like that too who effectively caused an alcohol ban in the cafe I was in (Malaysia). SEA Dota memes definitely came from way back when. It's funny though, once a fight starts, no one stepped in to stop it and started placing side bets instead. COD scrims were hilarious too.

What is dead may never die
                    I run a gaming cafe in Mumbai if you you’re ever around
                        Do people still come these days? How's the crowd now? Individual players or big groups? I felt ever since home internet got better, people preferred playing from home.
                            We still have video game cafes in Syria, lot of guys still play in them because we don't have electricity at home most of the day, while the cafes have power generators
    Do you still play sometimes, Wyk?
    IDK if other people have experienced this, but coaching may be borked. I went to coach some friends and all allies and enemies were in fog - I couldn't get vision anywhere!

I know it's not just me because I played against a stack that had a coach that also tried disconnecting and reconnecting several times before just leaving
        Had the same issue multiple times. Coaching a party completely borks being able to watch it, even when you close the game and reopen it. It also prevents you from being able to use the ‘watch friend live’ dota plus feature.
    While you are there can you please add the icon for the shield rune ? Pleaaaaaase
That's alot of "Fixed". WP Valve!
They finally fixed AA chilling touch dealing the same amount of damage at all levels
    Dude that shit was so fucked, I was sitting there thinking, what the fuck is up w this dmg at lvl 2
    I feel like even with 2 stacks, Chilling Touch was much worse than before, now with just applying 1 stack it feels really bad.
        It is worse. I played a lot of aa and it’s not as good in lane a harassing, you need to stack abilities more even before this letter patch. 

I feel like it’s better now if you get ags though? since you can add more stacks with subsequent chilling touches, if you’re going for machine gun aa it’s better than before. I’ve only played one game with AA so far since the innates and ags definitely felt stronger but I haven’t compared the numbers. Maybe it got nerfed because it was too oppressive if you build right click AA
            I mean, level 4 Cold Feet applies 8 stacks immediately. If you take the lvl 10 talent, it applies 10 stacks. That's much faster even than Aghs AA who has to attack 10 times to do it.

And you can make it AoE through facet

Thisk Aghs should upgrade it to 2 stacks.
> Dust devil sandstorm no longet gets destroyed if left by sand king

pretty huge that you can now blink stun and have it appear at the target location.

> Visage: Stone form: On self and Familiars have now immediate cast behavior by default.

THANK YOU.
    Its only a change if you were already fighting, since it has no cast time you could just click it after blinking, its rly good for farming tho since you can just blink away and it will keep killing creeps on its way to you
It begins. Wrought from the warped patch. Hammered til the birth of a TI worthy meta.
Terrorblade illus needing both mana and hp is still terrible. I don't know why they even added this in the first place, do they just want a way for people to go into a fight and sunder with low hp? Why would you pick this facet.
    You don't, and the fact that this was the only change TB got is such a massive "fuck you".
        This is an almost immediate letter patch after release. It's not strange they haven't come up with some huge change to that facet to make it viable in... 3 days? Just chill, bro.
        TB got a ton of regen on his already amazing shard. So just don't pick that facet and done, buffed.
    Sunder the illusion hehe
    When the numbers is buff enough, you can always farm nc no matter what hp by letting illu tank creeps. That is the point of the facet
        Except that's just a terrible concept to begin with, tb has so much armor he only struggles to tank stacked camps/ancients in the early game. 

And outside of that losing HP to spawn illus is only going to be a detriment, it's not like they're good to farm with once TB can tank neutrals himself thanks to the innate.

No amount of number tweaking is gonna fix this facet, at least not while the innate exist.
            I think of it like this, you are lvl 7, 1/4/1/1 or whatever, you got ganked and survive with 50 hp or whatever but full mana, instead of going back to base you just farm nc with illus. At that point you can keep doing that until you run out of mana and you then return to base
                Right, but so damn niche its insane, that like mby a 30 sec of more efficient farm for such an insane downside.

Like if you do go that skill build you're just griefing your own lane cause TB can't afford to be losing HP to get illus out with such a low HP Pool to begin with, and you have only lvl 1 meta and reflection for the lane.

And you can just courier out some Health regen if you really don't want to go back to base in that scenario, you're getting some mana reg send out anyways since you need it to spam out max lvl illus.

Like i get the concept, but its just *so fucking bad* and doesn't work with TB in any way shape or form in reality.
    i dont see even the slightest benefit from that facet, in late game it costs you significant hp!

and since the illusions get a dmg reduction if too far away, whats the point then?

even IF you want to go "sunder meme" build, u\`d still choose the other facet.

There is absolutely no synergy or logic behind that facet.

I mean they MUST have had some kind of initial  thought (perhaps a fever dream) , but i cant imagine what that would even be?  


It would atleast make sence if those were combined in a SINGLE  facet.

Ugh.
        They just seem deadest on sunder memes and trading HP for something as TB's core concept as of late for god knows what reason.

Wish they fucking stop and go back to what he used to be.
Delivered a patch right in the middle of a Sunday/Monday night. W devs
Thanks, Janitor, for working overtime this weekend!
    Holiday overtime, even, so it'll be pretty juicy.
        They have base salary with massive bonuses and no specific work hours
            It's pretty nice to do something you like and be rewarded for it. Then it feels like nurturing a product you're proud of, rather than putting overtime into work.
They seriously didn't even touch zeus?
    I swear Zeus has 0 counters right now. He does way too much damage and is way too safe.  
They need to fuck off his hop, most stupid change in all of dota history.
        im still salty since the introduction of heavenly jump. why is one of the strongest nuker in game has a mobility skill?
            Zues was a shxthole for ages. They tried everything until they gave him the jump.
                and jump was fine on shard
                they should have kept trying.
                lol no, Zeus was always top damaging by huge margin for many years before he got the jump. Many games he had 30k more damage than second best or so, completely insane
                See blink was a good viable option for zeus to escape or engage, they didnt have to give that mobility to him for free.
            I love playing Zeus and ya it made his kit literally do everything but hit towers. Gonna tinker around with a meteor hammer build. Maybe phylac kaya into manta / hammer then bkb/euls/aghs etc.

The fact he can escape over cliffs and also slows you is insane lol
                pugna and zeus is one kit away from being the perfect hero lol
                Also exclusively has one of the dumbest slows to exist he slows your cast time. I can’t think of anybody else having this type of slow.
            the hero was borderline unpickable in high mmr before heavenly jump
        Went pos5 zeus the other day
Ended up killing the LDs bear and got fb by just trading 9 hits 
Rolled over the game right after that
They attacks burn like fucking hell man
        I am somewhat ok with sniper grenade, but FUCK zeus jump. I'm sure the idea came from his taunt but the jump literally covers his only critical weakness which is a step taken in the LOL direction.
            If they removed the automatic lightning strike he does and the slow with it I'd be okay I suppose. Why does he get a better jump than mirana?
                The slow on it is absurd. 80% for 1.6 seconds even at lvl 1.
            Sniper has to buy his escape, same as they both had to with a force staff. Zeus, a hero designed to be caught as his counter, has a free escape now. AND IT FUCKING SLOWS YOU
        just give zeus a speed boost instead of slowing down everyone. heroes need to have weaknesses
        I feel like hop is "fine" if they just make it WAY shorter. Give him a way to hop up cliffs in a pinch, or hop out of stuff like cogs, just make it way shorter. Like earthshock distance.
        Zero counters? Are you serious?
Eternal shroud, mageslayer, bkb, pipe.
Anti mage, juggernaut, faceless void, storm spirit...
            Think they mean that he doesn't lose lane to anyone.
                Kotl, Ta, Necro, Sniper for start.
                He doesn't win either.  Zeus is just, consistent, which is great for solo pubs
        Techies doesn't get to be a degenerate anymore.

Tinker doesn't get to refresh items anymore

Fuck it, make it so Zeus doesn't get to deward on accident 24/7 anymore.
    I hate playing against support zues. That hero is dumb.
    NS given the lacroix "memories of debuff" treatment as well
    The only thing I hate about Zeus is early phylactery. He can easily proc it with arc lighting not only to boost up his damage output but to give him one more slow besides heavenly jump. Probably the phylactery user.
4 base strength buff Sven, that’s crazy
    a small consolation for the 12 str he lost in cleave that went undocumented.
        Yeah what the hell is that about? I thought I was going crazy, I could have sworn it gave str.
        why pick sven when DK is better now
    his gs could've just be 200% for a nicer sounding number
**Huskar**  

* Base armor increased by 1. 

**LITERALLY TAKING NO DAMAGE**
    OD armor reduce by 1. 

LITERALLY DIE TAKING DAMAGE
    I am the **GLORY** of your **SACRIFICE**
        DAMNIT DROW, CAN YOU HIT THE FUCKING SACRED WARRIOR??
    Without disarm he needed it lol..I just wish inner fire cast time was back to the old one. 0.5 is so clunky to use.
        It feels so bad now. Before you could use to stop a Spirit Breaker charge, but now it's so hard to do.
STICKY NAPALM

>No longer grants vision

Get fucked bat pickers
    I accidentally randomed bat yesterday against a TA and it was perhaps the funnest game I’ve had in a long time. Haven’t played him in years.

Needless to say everybody got fuego’d.
    There are like 3 bat players in pubs lol. This hero is only a menace in pro games
        I don't understand why he's not more popular. He has a bane level of absurd single target disable but with the ability to move it around. I suppose my tiny casual playing brain can still understand that it takes actual coordination to capitalize on a long stun.
            True. I love it when there's a competent bat player in my team. I ask him to connect with me whenever lasso is up and we go on a murder spree
            he can dominate early-mid games solo, but the efficient farming pattern on pos 4 is harder to learn compared to other pos 4s.

as a pos 2 if you aren't able to keep up tempo, and unlike other heroes like that (i.e. SF or Lina) he doesn't have the same straight forward manfight/solo kill in the late game, you really need to coordinate to be effective the later the game goes, and also again his efficient farming is harder to learn.

Ive seen so many bats stomp mid, then fall off completely both on my team and against them in ways others dont. Also playing him in late-game teamfights is hard, keeping napalm stacks up genuinely takes a lot skill.  

Hes still popular in high brackets and has a (damn) 56%? (tho on the meta tab its different than the "all matches tab" so it might only be 51%) WR according to D2PT but its an deceptively hard hero to get the most out of.  Hence why accross all brackets hes a horrible 43% WR.  Hell even im Divine/Immortal overall hes only 47%, you really need to get everything out of him for him to be OP
    Had a enemy mid bat yesterday. We won but laning him was so annoying.
        [deleted]
            w33 was playing quite a bit of him mid
            He's now throwing molotovs with the force of an angry irishman
    There are bat pickers? I haven't seen that hero in over a year.
    Thanks, I have been well and truly fucked.
    Are these bat pickers in the room with us right now?
I don't get what they are trying to do with Magnus' RRP. Pushing everyone apart is so situational I can't even come up with a situation where it would be useful.
    Well now its lower cooldown and a bigger aoe. There are at least some benefits.
        Yeah, now it's even worse by pushing enemies even further away. Unless I'm missing something I don't see how it's useful to set up anything, it just ruins any AOE nuke your team might have.
            It doesn't synergize with AoE like regular RP, but it's literally 60% larger radius (2.65x the total AoE) and has the same stun. It's basically an instant ravage that pierces bkb at this point. Normally to RP + skewer you need bkb against good players or you'll get hit by eul's or disables. This lets you isolate enemies and launch them into your team while stunning their teammates behind them with just blink dagger. At 100s and 700 radius I honestly think this spell will be oppressive. People just need to start using it correctly.
                Well, I can see how it could break up a teamfight and allow your team to pick off a couple of enemy heroes when they're scattered. Maybe in jungle it would be most effective when you push them on a different elevation.
                    If Magnus blinks between their frontline and their backline he will basically divide the enemy team. Giving the rest of the team quite a long time to burst down their frontline. Or he could have just RPd everyone and blown them up but there is at least some potential for RRP

Also given the extra range, if the enemy picks enigma or something like that. Magnus can switch facet to RRP for the increased range so he can actually interrupt blackhole.
                Yep, stun in large AOE alone makes it strong enough. Pushback is secondary effect at this point, but can work on it's own. And pushback helps in *not* making it a braindead simple spell, too. 

I think it's good enough as an alternative, at least. Can work vs big time ultimates like Black Hole or Chrono for example
                Wow, I seriously think this gonna be busted by pro players. 

This could be used as a counter to diving comp.
            700 aoe is like 60% bigger than his RP.

When you think RP, your brain goes to 3 man, 4 man - but the most effective RPs you'll see in pubs only need to hit TWO at most. With 700 aoe, you're practically guaranteed to hit at most 3 at the same time.
                I'm surprised more people can't imagine how a stun of this size could be good. It's harder to play around too - requires team to be spaced even further apart than normal vs magnus.
                    Imagine how well this works with high single target nuke. Push important core into teammates, while the rest of the enemy are sent flying, stunned, and all into different directions and fucking their positioning. Kill the single target and collapse onto the next closest by order of importance.
                        Yeah I think people are thinking about it in the wrong way. They're trying to compare it to RP, which makes sense as a first reaction, I get it (and the original version was kinda awful). But I think it's more like a weird super-Lasso. Something you use to put a hero or two horribly out of position and get pickoffs. Kinda hard to stop it in a teamfight too, the AoE is big and it pierces BKB, most of their team is getting hit with it.
                            Yeah, they even reduce the cooldown by a whooping 20 sec.

It's way more spamable now, stakes are lower, getting 1 man RP is more acceptable.
                    This just turns him into a counterinitiation powerhouse, it doesn’t have the same ceiling potential as RP but is much easier to hit. Prolly a good 4
            Push enemies into T4, refresh, push enemies into fountain. If they escape, skewer back xD
                you can do that with normal RP though. in fact its easier with normal rp because its easier to skewer after. and using refresher negates the benefit of reverse rp (lower cooldown)
                    Yeah but you technically gain more distance right?
RP (pushes them) + run up to them, skewer.

I still agree it's crap though haha
                so choose this facet in the beginning of the game because you expect to lose?
            The enemy jumps as 5 on your carry, you RRP them, I guess.
            There’s been shit like this no one understands. Eventually someone will come up with something and it’ll be good , or it’ll be changed
            Sometimes it is better to skewer 1 person rather than the entire team. Especially true if some players have aeon disk or status resist etc, or your team might be lacking burst damage, etc etc. And with the stun it means the enemy team can't counterinitiate that fast. There are quite a few use cases. For example, RRP near cliff's edge = some people will be pushed low ground and you can break highground that way.

The use cases are plenty, but the actual problem with this facet is that you lose the normal RP forever. Everyone would call this facet OP if it allowed you to choose between the two by alt-cast.
            I'm thinking you act like a clock. Just go in and separate the enemy team from one another whilst pushing some targets towards your allies. So maybe the play is RRP and skewer yourself to safety. 

Idk how hard it is to pull off though and there's so much anti synergy.
    Shove everybody out of Rosh pit?
        wouldnt you rather just RP everyone inside the rosh pit on top of each other and use aoe to win the game rather than just pushing them apart

like i just fundamentally dont understand, any circumstance where youd want to split them up, you'd be better off clumping them up instead

if it keeps getting buffed and gets its CD lowered enough i can imagine it being viable as a skill used multiple times in a single fight
            when your team dont want to come contest rs, but you alone want to
            It's a trade off. In return you get a bkb piercing ravage.
        Feel like it would be better to just rp them in that case and your team can pile on em + additional rosh hits lol.  Imagine you rrp and then get bashed.
    Havent played it yet but are you not able to, under a certain angle, push enemies sieging your base inside, like 1 or 2 of them, while splitting them away from their teammates to save them?
    Man RRP would be so good if it randomly left 1 hero near magnus while it pushes everything else far. Like an instant 1 focus button.
        Could be interesting as a hero targeted ability: Target hero stays, everyone else goes.
            And make magnus let out a primal roar when he casts it.
    The only thing I've heard that isn't something you could already do with RP + skewer is to use it split push like an AM. IE, you can safely push lanes by yourself with empower because if anyone tries to gank you, you have an emergency escape button that pushes everyone away from you and then you can skewer + blink away lol

It sounds like a really fucking dumb way to play Magnus and I can't imagine it'd actually be good, but it at least uses RRP in a way that serves some purpose
        cant you just do that with regular RP in theory

if enemies are positioned in an unideal way itll be easy to accidentally push them super far in the direction you want to escape. by the time you skewer away they will not be stunned and chase u. seems cooked i fear
        But how would you blink "away" if you have pushed enemy heroes to the spots you could potentially blink to? IMO unless they make RRP to apply some strong debuff this also doesn't sound like a good plan to me.
    Should work well with puck coil, but it’s still hard to follow-up. Also, i think it could be good as a defense strategy, to ensure b, and use it like willow ulti
    I find it fun. It makes it a repositioning ult rather than just waiting for a clump. Also gives creativity by pushing a lot more heroes into your team if properly used. Yeah there's skewer, I know... but it adds to magnus's kit as a repositioner. Just my 2 cents.
Huuuuge nerf to bat. Napalm not giving vision is such a colossal nerf
    almost feels like an overreaction considering its just a letter patch.
Goodbye LC abusers time for us true LC lover to truly shine.   
LC removed from ban list , welcome Slark.
    as LC player - fuck Slark and his shard
        They should make his shard not terminate duel, make it like glimmer where the person still has the invisibility but denying the whole duel is such bullshit, 1400 gold to make a hero completely irrelevant in teamfights kek
    We will be back soon
    I swear the only people that like Slark are people who play him because they can get away from 99% of the bad plays they make by slamming keys mindlessly and hitting R occasionally. Finding a genuinely good Slark is like finding an Invoker that can actually use more than 2-3 spells a game.
Those subtle Tinker buffs ain’t gonna be enough.
    This buff to translocator facet is stupid too. Just let him rearm blink if they're going to go down this path. But instead we're trying to push some low skill alternative where he just randomly blinks a little if someone goes on him with no agency from the Tinker player.

Realistically the Eureka buff is pretty significant. Hitting 180 int isn't nearly as absurd as 240. But in every way it just seems like a worse design compared to the old Tinker. Now the hero farms for ages and comes online later because you need arcane blink and possibly octarine. But in exchange, there's even less counterplay if he eventually does because you can't even interrupt rearm to stop saving items.
    Just as predicted - they will keep buffing his numbers until OP. Yet change nothing about the fact that he is no longer fast-button pressing, no cd hero what was the fun part about him
        to be fair they made his int-CDR buff 33% faster
            He'll soon use int dagger without cd at all. Then things will become fun. And then no cd dagon...
            Hero now gets 1.1% cdr on items per level.
            and made his random blink throw you even more out of position
    Support Tinker is already good
        Lmao, god, imagine a tinker spammer realising he's a support now. Good Times.
            Works as intended
            Tjnker Shield + Solar Crest is actually goated. March of the machines being back means you can run around ratting and be back to your team instantly as need.
                That's fine by me. Just the mental image of the tinker spammers realising that they have to play with their team, and can't run around getting pick offs every minute, with infinite blink hex rocket lazor, ending the game 30-0-0, brings a tear to the eye.
        Pos 4-5 Tinker is his best role with a whopping 37% winrate.
        You have an interesting definition of "good".
patch at 11pm on memorial day weekend is crazy
    Probably was already worked in except maybe some final touches and they were just waiting for DL to end.
    Alive gaem
Tinker still ass.
Sad to see no Invoker or Shadow Fiend buffs. Invoker's Agnostic facet is terrible as it doesn't work per instance. SF now has to decide between two facets which were previously just included in the hero (slow on shadow raze and potdl -armor increase on kill. Both heroes not looking good winrate wise
    The real SF buff was adding cast speed increases back into the game. I've seen a couple of spell-build SFs and they did fine.
    >Invoker's Agnostic facet is terrible as it doesn't work per instance.

Sorry maybe I'm being dumb here, what do you mean it doesn't work 'per instance'? Like only one instance of each orb has an effect?
        For example it says that Exort passively grants 3/6/9/12/15/18/21 bonus attack damage when leveling up. I thought that when going 3x Exort you'd be getting 9 bonus attack damage level 1, just like his old iteration. It turns out he just gets 3 bonus attack damage no matter how many or what orbs you use, making the facet somewhat disappointing
            You never got 9 attack damage level one, agnostic is same dmg on exort but doesnt matter what orbs youre using, elitist is just last patch orbs but worse. 
    could be interesting to give feast of souls +MS in addition to the mild-scaling AS, would bring old speed demon sf back with utility for both right click and caster builds
Core abaddon in shambles ;(
    I'm sad. Used to spam him alot
    They really shut the Font of Avernus and told us to go home :(. He's my second favorite hero (also lvl 30). Aba enjoyers lost today.
    apparently they *really* didn't like core abaddon
Can the guy responsble for balacing earth spirit please take a long hard look in the mirror. These changes are non sensical, getting a stone infront of you after ending rolling boulder will make it (more) difficult to kick back enemies  and make it impossible to quickly scilence any strong disabling spells.

Please, just play the hero and you'll see for you self. 

Here's an idea: buff the left facet dmg number  50/100/150 and ult dot slightly.

And change the right one to have no cast point and increase the duration and cast range on grip. Or make it grip enemies but without the aforementioned buffs (this might be a bit strong)

Your welcome.
    You and all the other 6 earth spirit mains (me me me me me) are nodding in agreement
    Brother the facet is for me who is too noob to kick a hero back XD
    Have the right one make boulder stun and roll slow.
>Fixed Light Collector incorrectly having a 25% penalty instead of 75%

Seriously? This was the case for half a year, and it was a bug? Everyone knew about this
I did not even realize when the patch came. I was about to start the game and thought let me look at the TA changes for 7.36 and see a 7.36a update sitting there :D
    She's so busted now lol 




 She was literally the 10th most contested hero in wallachia and dreamleague before the patch, in low ranks she does bad and then they removed most of the shortcomings from her refraction and got buffed in her psi blades and got mega buffed with the Facets, and now she's way overtuned because she's balanced around refraction being instances - redditors kept crying about her being unplayable despite being a meta hero in pros because they don't know how to use refraction
        I'm still pissed at range nerf of innate psi's. It makes no sense to even have it as innate if you don't have enough range to damage range creep through melee creep on lane, i'm not even talking about hero.
"dev team lazy"
That was fast! 

Thanks for working during the weekend and making gaem gudd!🥰
0 changes to Tusk with the worst winrate ever…
    i’m so desperate for a buff to my snow dude it doesn’t feel like there’s a single point in the game where he can reliably get on top of someone and lock them down let alone do any dmg
Tinker is receiving multiple buffs but those are like tiny drops of the ocean he lost.
    I’m just waiting for tinkers in my games to go march each lane and do nothing in team fights like they use to do back in the day.
    Good
Just when jugg got a bit of attention... BOOM!  

The PA Q interacting with its facet is pretty cool, hope we get to see more interactions with old established skills and the new facets
    The pa facet is unsalvageable. It’s really bad compared to usual facet and you’re giving up blur as well. I don’t understand why they had to nerf pa this bad
        The problem is the 6 hit counters I feel, if they made it 5 then that's the equivalent of 20% critrate over the course of the game assuming you don't change targets
            It would still be bad. The only scenario where the facet is good is if you burst one target immediately. If one crit isn’t enough, facet 1 pa can crit 2 times. Facet 2 pa will have to do 10 hits. And if you don’t manage to do enough hits your stacks are reset and you don’t crit at all. That’s not mentioning that you give up rapier+dagger playstyle and blur farming. It is an insane nerf.
                Yeah, same target restriction must be removed to even become comparable to old behaviour.
                They need to make it like Slardar bash and have the counter on PA, not on enemies.
            It's 6 because it used to be 17% which is 100/6 so they just made it the same percent of attacks but hit counters instead of random.
        I mean theoretically it's just straight up more damage. They made it 6 hits because the regular ability has a 17% proc rate, which is 100/6 - just with the new facet you also do more damage
    Well deserved, jugg is still op
        I thought most people were using the spin facet? Sad cause I’ve been away and wanted to try the agi one, sounds cool thought the agi % value was a bit high but the fade of 3 seconds seems fine specially as any damage cancels it
    So with talent lv25 she will able to crit, and she can stack buff to make her crit 2x with her Q
Really thought SB’s aghs would get a cool down on Planar Pocket.
Wtf you cant force out of pounce anymore?
Valve brother you cannot buff Reverse Reverse RP into being good
    you say that but people were also saying that about lifestealer aghs and that it was a meme.....
        Lifestealer aghs didn't remove his best ability
        lifestealer aghs would have been much worse if it made you no longer able to target allies
        Infesting enemy hero was bad until it gets the disarm which I would argue was a pretty big rework.

RRP is also bad in that it is basically a disengage. But a disengage spell almost completely contradicts Magnus's other identity as a melee auto-attacker.
            20 seconds infest is also good, the nerf with cooldown ticking after exit sucked
    It doesn't have to be good, most facets are terrible for pro play. They are designed to reintroduce some fun into casual pubs
Thank you Gaben for LC and Wraith King nerfs
Nothing at all about queen of pain? They really think she is fine?
    Her spell lifesteal facet is probably basically fine.  She just matches up really badly into this meta, where every core is either a Strength hero, buys Mage Slayer or Eternal Shroud, or both.  QoP's just a pile of numbers and abilities that don't quite add up to anything right now.
damn it CM got nerfed I was enjoying the free AoE AoE
I dont understand the force change at ALL,

that buff was added not too long ago because theres little counterplay to leash like slark and it was broken as fk


Now they bring it back

??????????
    2018-11-19 = "not too long ago" lol
        Time is a circle you can’t force staff out of.
        netural items are still new bro
    Gotta make WINDWAKER ON EVERY HERO even MORE mandatory.
    No, that buff was added when leash was changed to prevent all movement abilities. It used to be that you could blink, ball lightning, timewalk etc out of leashes like slark pounce, but force staff wouldn't work - when they made leash prevent all those movement abilities they changed it so that only force (and other forced movement like meat hook etc) would break it. I think slark kinda sucks rn so it's not a terrible change.
        slark sucking is good for the game.
        If you have no counterplay at all as a supp even with items that also sucks....
    It's an indirect buff to Ghost Scepter and Eul's, that have both almost completely left the realm of support item because of Force + Glimmer being the main choice in almost literally every game and situation. Sure, it sucks getting jumped by a Slark, but just forcing away (which is an item you would've bought *anyway*) and suddenly Slark is essentially rendered useless also makes no sense. I'm not saying I love the change, but I don't hate it.
Storm Spirit is fucked
    Damn, 0.4 mana regen removed. Hero is dead
Huskar 10 attack speed and 1 Armor? I don't think that makes up for the HORRENDOUS cast point of his Q in any way
    Just don’t press q 4Head
Bro why did they nerf force staff vs slark? Are melee supports also required to buy pike? 

Btw can someone confirm if Manta dispells slark leash? Can't test right now
    No it doesn't
        So why does euls dispell it but not manta?
is ww just a walking wisdom rune multiplier now?
    Being able to splinter blast allies is such a huge buff I am not mad
        Wait, can you self-cast splinter blast now too? I can finally play wyvern without having a migraine?
            I think splinter still cannot be cast on WW herself
            Nah, it is allies but not self.  It is still a massive buff imo
                Played a game of wyvern and it felt so nice to be able to cast on allies damage feels really reliable in fights especially with aoe talents.
    She is still way better than before the patch
    she just got a huge ass buff with her splinter blast do you even play the hero?
Spirit breaker not getting touched is ab insane out of touch move by icefrog.

For context, XP Bonus is fucking insane, it gices the supports even more XPs aside from the wisdom rune bonuses and if the game goes wild that supports are higher level than cores, then the fucking cores gets the bonus XP.

That shit is equivalent to the OLD GPM talents, needs to be addressed ASAP
    It feels like SB has been untouched since the great Bara confluence of the Bara Dark Seer patch. 

Ever since then it's just been Bara in every 2nd game unless banned.
that's a lot, hopefully they also fix the optimization issue since 7.36
Timber escaped nerfs again.
    Look at his win rates ..47% ..43% across the brackets. Just because two of the best players in the world play it well doesn’t mean it’s OP
    Because his winrate on d2pt is bad and it's falcons who are OP 

I still want timber nerfs but that's probably why
        earth spirit got nerfed because of 2 players, while being one of the lowest winrate heroes in the game. we can hope (cope)
    47% winrate hero escape nerfs
    There's the small nerf to Shroud, I suppose
    Your average Joe is not gonna make timber look op lmao, hero is busted only if the player knows what they're doing.
wow they really dont give a fuck about TB man . he is literally unplyable with that innate just remove it man it makes him worst in every way
[deleted]
going to try tinker support a few more times, feels like it has more potential after these changes. core tinker still fucked though i reckon
    Idk, I play it as pos 3 and it’s fine because I feel he needs a but more that regular support gets
Thankyou for patching quickly. Perfect fix to the visage issues with stone form thankyou. 

Leash change seemed unnecessary though?
who tf thought it'd be a good idea to buff slark pounce? can't force staff away is just dumb jeez
    You mean back to how it was for like 6 years

As a support player making force staff work on pounce was the biggest W

Back to the dark days I supposd
Visage enjoyers unite! They fixed Stone Form!
    Visage notes nit pick : Being that guy.. but .. valve used the word "casted" instead of just cast.
Singsing is gonna spam POTM of the Moon even harder
    Do not believe in yourself, believe in me that believes in you arrow of POTM of the moon
-SingSing
wait what?? patch on sunday? That too on a long weekend? W Valve!!
+20 base hp for Chen Convert Creep LFG

Elder Titan had needed 375 movespeed to BREAK EVEN on the attack speed lost with Momentum. Much deserved buff.

Also 295 mana avatoss combo, that's a lot.
What did they do to my man Abbadon 😭

At least my venomancer is still untouched 😏
Someone really loves zeus on the dev team.
Not a single fix to drow. They really think 12% agility is a worthy ult. Not even bother to buff the proc damage/ chance.
Juggernaut got murdered, somehow I feel like the LC changes still aren't going to be enough.
    Not even close to murdered, he is still strong. His both facets were 57%+ winrate, he deserved these changes, its just now the Blade Fury one might make even more sense to pick.

As for LC, shield being 50% less is a lot to limit her lane capabilities, which is the reason she snowballed so hard.
    The hard dispel on spin end is still insanely powerful. There's basically no way to stop a spinning jug from omnislashing immediately afterward.
    He's still pretty strong
    He still has the broken 10% bonus damage talent. He will be fine.
    Now jugg is just good not holy fuck we lose good
    The nerfs aren't enough to offset him having a pretty crazy Strong Dispel. He's still going to be a great pick.
Timber untouched. What the actual fuck
W patch. Lot of overpowered heroes nerfed. This should make the patch even more fun. Don't forget to change your banned hero list boys.
Seems like they're really trying to pivot Tinker into a support who can always join the team and then pump out marches and matrixes to make it a nightmare push into his team.
Their tried to boost morph, but did I understand correctly that with talent on 20 lvl he now doesn't do full damage?)

Also, why kill heroes like void spirit, he was in trenches for years
    they moved half of the damage of the lv20 talent to base waveform itself. when you take the talent it's the same as before
RIP Pangolier... Unplayable hero and they give him extra shield crash damage rofl
> Frozen Expanse AoE bonus now only applies to Crystal Maiden.


Wait, how did it work before??
they should set tinker rearm to affect items back but set to 3/2/1 seconds cooldown.
Why does rearm still have CD?
    it goes on CD if it's cancelled iirc
The tooltip on Clinkz in game still stays "Clinkz and all his skeletons...." for Burning Barrage. So what exactly did they fix?
Nothing done to bara? Haven’t won’t a game against him yet. Unkillable
So 5 neutral item techies wasn't a bug
Visage change doesn't even work... When he's silenced it doesn't let you drop birds remotely. Works if he's stunned though 🧐
Still no idea what tinker is supposed to be ...
Force no longer works on leashed targets and Slark buff.

Time to play the fish boiiiiis.
I have to assume there’s some gigarare Timbersaw cosmetic coming out because the hero was like the most played at the end of 7.35 in multiple roles, the hero got a free aghs in 7.36 and is picked roughly every game, and he’s still not nerfed here.
RRP from magnus remember Flux from HoN, but the RRP from influx was changeable and GLOBAL, it didn't stun, just a power slow.

So you could be anywhere on the map and could pull or push enemies away, to help kill or make an ally survive, this would be a could facet!
HOW IS TIMBER DIDNT GET ANY NERF ???
Still same mirana innate ability O_o 🥲🙃
Timber and (effectively) DK left alone? 

Cacaw!
DK basicly untouched is shit ngl…
Oof. Another nasty nerf to my boy Abaddon, particularly in the support role. He aghs is now much worse than before. Big sad.
I will just retire now, too much for a weekend player. :(
