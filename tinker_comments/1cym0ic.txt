As a Night Stalker spammer I feel sad as well, I can't ruin Tinker spammers' games anymore :(
    Because they are already ruined?
        Ye I mean, can't hard counter tinker players if they don't pick him anymore lmao
            I used to be a filthy tinker spammer from 2014to 2023. Then I might've picked him 3 times the past year. Now I am not even gonna pick him. They essentially just nerfed him to the ground and took away what made him unique.
                Thank you Valve for destroying Tinker.
        Yes. YES. YES!!!!!!!!!
    How did NS use to counter Tinker?
        Tinker used to rely on spamming spells from trees and re-arm blink away so it was hard for you to track him normally. With NS you just press ulti, jump + silence him, void him if he tries to TP out and he basically became a sitting duck because he is usually teleporting to lanes far away from rest of his team
    i am a main NS myself, the latest patch for NS is just bad, that scepter replacement from previous patch Void skill was pretty good and we can move fast during day time and now it is just a stupid toggle, it is just a big L for NS mains
        Ye I played some games now and not the biggest fan. As mostly offlane NS I also don't like the inverse day/night facet. In my games I became a sitting duck in min 5-10 because of daytime and no ulti yet. Definitely prefer to bully enemy out of lane after min 5 to this
    Lmao I’m a mid NS spammer and love ruining tinker games
Legit confused me, tried it in Turbo, my whole team was winning and I still couldn’t figure what the fuck I’m supposed to do
    When I saw that line of the patchnotes, I was thinking "Yikes, that's a HUGE Tinker nerf".
        What do you mean Huge Tinker nerf? Dude is a creep
    you have to build arcane blink + octarine to resemble old tinker. cooldown is low enough that you can blink around spamming march almost like its 2014.
    I'M IN SHAMBLES. 1.7K GAMES WITH TINKER FOR NOTHING
        Filthy tinker player
            Yup, nothing of value has been lost.
                I will never miss tinker's missiles.
            Stinker for short.
        Time to learn meepo or something idk
            Just play a non cancerous hero XD
        YOU'RE DOOOOOOOMED
        You can rest now, your journey has come to an end
        Good.
        U deserve worse man
        Thats how I felt when they took the green and freeze mines from techies. The whole game changed. It was like he was a completely different character after that.
            > It was like he was a completely different character after that.

Yes well...that *was* the idea lol
            At least techies got a good rework and tinker was already dead and now completely useless
                Generic bomberman ain't a good rework. Prior, techies was about map control

Now he is garbage bomberman
                    lol it is a good rework, rather than a 4 v 5 fight with a dumb techies roaming around
                    Now he is hypercarry endgame 9slot pos1. Gotta think outside the box
                Good, maybe they should just remove him completely. Would make the game better.
                    well then, better remove half of the heroes, because some abilities annoys some people, let's make lol from dota 2
            > The whole game changed. 

Praise Gaben.
        And thats a good thing
        SAME HERE! Tinker spammer for nothing. Those weird shapes I made with my hand over the keyboard... I will never use them again? Should probably learn guitar.
            https://youtu.be/vZDjWLwqAPY
            oh btw I just got a Blue lava beginner guitar. It isn't so expensive ($179) acoustic. Im in the US so you don't see decent beginner guitars cheaper than that. If you are serious about learning guitar
            Real.
        Honestly I played him as pos 4 and all that changed is I don't rush blink anymore and don't feel compelled to build force and glimmer.
        Now it is pos5 support:

Always in fight

Laser give miss to enemy cores

Give shield

Heal with machines

Rearm, repeat. As a bonus with level you items can be used a little bit more.
Also you can tp push other lines with machines

i see tinker now with Guardian Greaves, glimmer, force staff, maybe lotus/linken, and probably Aether Lens somwhere after GG
        Mate, it’s never too late to seek professional help.
        Play 4
        Bye
        First they came for Techies, and I did not speak out because I don't play Techies...
    I tryed a few times. Early impact fcked but you come up whit net worth so much more, like 14 min i already have a blink soulring dagon. Everything on the map is tinker farm, yes, you cant blink blink blink but only one blink need to the jungle next to the lane and you can send a march and tp out

The old classic work well whit pubs (dagon, eblade, blink)
    You are the laser blinder and missile bitch
    Maybe he could work as a support with the motm healing in a death ball push lineup?
Old Techies sends his regards
    I miss him so much....
Keen conveyance will become a free blink dagger next patch and rearm will reset its cd. 

Back to buying boots of travel.

Edit: Innate will include no TP scroll cooldown.
    I could actually see this. Would nerf the str blink build which would be nice
        Str blink build is already dead though?
            Yeah.. but it's still a nice purchase on this current version of tink tho
    This ... actually doesnt sound half bad? However the whole point of re-arm 90% of the time was for items

The 10% of time it's not is when his aghs is good, but they gutted his aghs lol
    i could actually see this happening but it basically just replaces one issue for the other. he'd have mobility like he kind of needs to have but he will have no recourse for running out of mana other than afking for 30 seconds waiting for bots cd
        Tinker Innate will include: Town Portal Scroll has no cooldown.
Yes! Smurfs accounts in shambles.
    Now they are gonna pick overbuffed meepo which is ten times worse than a tinker.
        meepo still takes more effort to play than tinker.
            Tinker was already weak in 7.35 and now its just garbage.
            Nah
People hate tinker, but do people really see him much? I legitimately can’t remember the last time I saw him, playing daily in high divine.

EDIT: Just looked it up, I literally haven't seen Tinker in about 350 games, at least not as an enemy.
    Higher the skill level, easier it is to deal with tinker since players know what to do. Average reddit player is not a high ranked player. Do the math
        This is true, And yet I feel like so many of the people in this subreddit preface their comments with “in my immortal games…”
            I’m sure the overlap between people who try hard enough to get immortal and people who care enough to comment on dota reddits are quite large
        Yet valve seems to primarily balance the game around what Redditors want these days. When's the last time Tinker was picked in a pro game? He had sub 50% winrate too. 

Appealing to 2k mmrs is ruining this game
            Yea but which bracket has more players? If you just think only the pros or immortals deserves to play ( and i think you arent one)  then the game is surely dead.
                > ( and i think you arent one) 

Based on what exactly lmfao

https://www.opendota.com/players/151844361/

> If you just think only the pros or immortals deserves to play

Not what I said. I said the game shouldn't be balanced based on what the lowest common denominator doesn't like.
                Bad players don't need to be catered to because they can and should learn.
            The last time probably was when kiyotaka solo killed that terrorblade in his base! Cant remember who that was but it was a long time ago i think!
        Not exactly true. On higher ranks tinkers get very good at positioning and are hard to deal with. On lower ranks they would just step out of position very often. Of course I’m talking about players playing in their ranks not smurfs
    Cast range on laser was nerfed quite severely in 7.35, which made him a really weak laner , so people generally stopped picking him much. But we have 10+ years of trauma contributing to the hate, one patch where he's weak isn't enough...
        if you've played hearthstone before it reminds me of how much of a haterboner that community has for priest, even though priest was (at least by the time i stopped playing) almost always a dogshit class all the time. doesnt matter every dumbass raged every time priest could play the game at all
    My last game yesterday was a dude running hacks with tinker flying all over the place doing crazy shit. I'm perfectly fine with seeing him reworked to a state that's not so trivial to exploit.
    Tinker has two states.

* If viable, he is played every other game and ruins every match he is in.
* If not viable, he is solely played by smurfs, ruining every match he is in.

Tinker was a *plague* on this game. He will not be missed.
    Good riddance
    I play turbo only and he gets picked maybe 5-10% of my games. so not that uncommon there.
        The hero literally needs a million gold and xp and then he becomes a force. For like 20 min he's very underwhelming. Now with this remake he's gonna ve underwhelming for 40 mins but it's okay because everyone playing him will just farm and push lanes with march till min 60 where he'll have max cdr.
    He hasn't been playable since they nerfed laser to 450 cast range (which they just undid partially). This was to open up design space because having to consider the ramifications of a hero who makes items have a max of 1.5 second cooldown severely limits what you can do with them, unless you lock the hero out from buying it, but you don't want to do that as it's confusing for new players.
    I'm low mmr, and literally the only time I see him is when some asshole smurf picks him and ruins everyones game while typing "HAHAHAHAHA NOOBS" in chat every 30 seconds while a million Shivas goes off. I know the hero was bad in higher mmr brackets but nothing in this patch made me happier than to see him get absolutely fucked.
        If that's your reasoning for getting a hero gutted then you're pretty stupid. Also that smurf could've done the same to you and your teammates with cm mid rushing treads + buriza. Take that as you will.
    Seeing 1 Tinker within 100 games, is already 1 too many
        1/100 would be far higher than I'm seeing.
At this point, just delete the hero.
    Yeah, tinker whole kit is revolving around dagger to move around.

Atleast when they decided to rework techies it is viable.
Tinker with 243 int (Shiva, Int Blink, Vyse, E Blade, Waker) can use Int Blink once every 2.8 secs, 2.1 with Octarine. Vyse with 8 secs or 6 secs cd. I'm no Tinker player, but what about Meme Hammer? It's 9.6 or 7.2 secs cd. I'm just saying.
    >with 243 int (Shiva, Int Blink, Vyse, E Blade, Waker, Octarine)

So what you are saying is "play the game after 60+min?"

Dagger is like legs for tinker, Im kind of fine(not rly but) with every other item, but taking away dagger from a hero that doesnt buy boots anymore?
        Innate ability to pick one item to re-arm isn’t asking for much
        Suggestion. Buy some move speed. Most heroes do that.
            Most heroes don't have their kits balanced around having to chanel for 3 secs. What use is boots if a hero 30ms slower than you can outrun you if you have to stop for 3 secs
                Buy shadow amulet like all other normal heroes in the game 😜
            I want to keep the heroes that aren't like most heroes. Tinker doesn't need to be like most heroes.
        WTF do you mean taking away dagger? Is there some unwritten text that says he can't buy dagger anymore? 

No. All they did was make it so tinker can't have MotM going in all 3 lanes at the same time anymore - the most cancerous strat in Dota history.
            except he can still do that because now he has march again, with free travels at 6, which is arguably worse than "old-old" tinker that still had to buy travels at least. so people are going to complain about the same things as before - tinker stalling out games with very low chance to win due to march - and this situation is also more likely to happen because the hero is very weak atm (32% winrate), so he's more likely to be in these one-sided games.

so no one's happy. people that like tinker obviously wont be a fan of the nerfs, and people that don't like tinker are still going to complain, it's just shifted from "this hero beats me too often" to "this hero delays my win too often"
            tinker can still go to every lave he wants. Its about what he does there.
        I guess it's time to play tinker like a tank spell caster.
        you still have all the spells but no shiva, can buy kaya maybe idk, never played tinker
            Shivas was primarily for farming, with march back won't be that much of an issue but the issue is blink. Tinker is blink u get caught as tink u die no spells can help. He has become np
            Problem is no blink. This is biggest nerf i ever saw
        Just buy boots? Problem solved
            Bad luck with void bash? Just buy bash, problem solved.
                Unlucky your hero got nerfed xD my hero got a free blink
    How do you even plan to get those items lol? afk farm with march for 60+ minutes?
        This comment is hilarious because that's literally what tinker was 10 years ago LMAO. You just march the entire map until you're 6 slotted, let your entire team scream at you for farming everything, then feed and lose.
            Yeah, but you had a blink reset. Now you do the same, but way slower, and you can't even travel to creeps until level 12. It's way worse now and if you don't think it is then you didn't play the tinker version you're mentioning lol.
                Na I don't disagree with you. I was just laughing at the "what do you do? afk farm?" part of your comment.  

That's the last time I really played tinker. I am fucking awful at not blinking into terrible situations with him so I was much better at the passive push waves out and let the rest of my team get bigger tinker.
        no idea, actually. i was just looking at heroes earlier when i was reading the patch and tried it and it made me chuckle, so i made this senseless comment.
    Wow so u only need 30k networth and 25 levels to do what a tinker could do at level 6 pre patch! The nerf really doesn't seem too harsh when you put it like that :)
        No nerf is to harsh for tinker players
            yes imagine enjoying playing a character in a videogame bro such degeneracy 🤡
    I don't give a fuck if they make every item 2s cd and give him 9000 HP, it's a different hero, less fun hero, not the hero I've been playing for 10 years.
    After 70 minutes you can be worse than before, hooray!
I hope this hero stays dead forever. Fuck your 0 cooldown blink, fuck your 0 cooldown hex, and fuck your 0 cooldown shiva.
    I still remember this sequence like it was yesterday. Tinker blinked in from off the screen and hexed me, which was basically game over for me because he had no cooldown. I was "big" but it didn't matter because Tinker had no cooldowns.
    this dogshit rework is just going to result in him getting some absolutely absurd buffs in the b patch in a week or 2 that will lead to you crying even more. thats how they handled medusa's cooked rework, they just forced it. same thing is gunna happen here
        Medusa is actually balanced now
            yeah but it took several patches of her being dogshit and then later the most OP hero in the game before we got to that point, tinker is probably gunna go through the same process. the same people going "idc he was bad fuck tinker pickers they deserve the wall" are going to be complaining about how OP he is in two weeks after they give him debuff immunity while his barrier is active or something
                It's better that he's balanced without the 0 CD item as his mechanic. I can wait
                It's still easier to balance only his abilities and not his abilities + all the item actives. 

Better have him op for some time then balanced, than either op or dumpster tier because they can't balance him and the items
                wait a minute, let this guy cook
                tinker has been horrible the last couple years, i tried him in a pub a few weeks ago and it was nearly unplayable. the only people still complaining about him must be herald.

anyways you’re right, in about 3 months tinker will have some absolutely vile number buffs and put him in the strongest state since 2014
                    YESSSSSS, my 1k games of tinker will finally be put to use~~~
            yeah that's why they nerfed her twice for no reason in this patch. great job everyone!
                right cause after you change literally every other hero, she’s gonna be totally fine same as 7.35
                    give all the other heroes a new skill, and then also don't give medusa a new skill but actually make her old one worse! game balance!
                        Yup, appealing to pos 5 players makes me sick.
We get -200 mana and option to spend 40% of our EHP on attack speed, Shadow Shaman gets a new spell + a sick facet

The whole patch looks like let's give a 5th spell to guys without scaling passives, and screw the ones that already have one
                            tbf engorge is quite good but like... why randomly do a drive-by nerf on mana shield lmao
                                >engorge is quite good

Is it?

If there are a lot of our favorite tanky heroes, they do not have a lot of mana, but are highly resistant to physical damage.

Well, maybe after lvl 25 talent (engorge charges are used, but not  spent by the split shot procs), and with 5 bounces on 2k+ only mana heroes it is gruesome...

But usually the opponents are not so nice to just stand there grouped up for your snake (and normal agi carries do not have 2k mana usually)

I am sad, I am a 29 lv. tanky medusa enjoyer, and Gaben tells me to play the glass cannon until 6th slot
                                    gives you like +10 damage for last hitting after using snake on ranged creep
        After what happened to Techies, I'm not so sure about that. Then again, Techies got an overhaul while Tinker is just getting a swap out of skills.
        How the hell can you... Think about FUTURE patches when the patch JUST came out???
            its just precedent  tinker has a 32% win rate rn. they usually put out a letter patch within a few days of massive patches like these to adjust the extreme outliers and I am simply expecting tinker to get adjustments when that happens

not complicated
            > How the hell can you... Think about FUTURE patches when the patch JUST came out???

=

Some things do take time honestly. Look  at all the heroes like Pudge or Silencer whose innate is literally an ability they already had, while everyone else gets some cool new things.  Some times Valve plays it safe  with changes and sometimes they go wild and tone it down later. Tinker will be tweaked over time to a healthier design  IMO. Not everything can be perfectly balanced at the first initial change.
        Yeah worry about future patches LMAO. He's gonna be buffed and nerfed if it's too strong. Who cares about that.
        just now its going to be a generic walker mid or a generic walker support
        Balanced until you pick a nyx to counter grief and its been glorioussssssss.  All the pain, all the suffering she caused, nyxéd away
    Fuck their 60 minute games too
    I didn't know rearm was instant
    1 sec cooldown\*
        If you are on high ping might as well be instant
    Ah yes thankfully dota doesnt have heroes as polarizing as that, surely we dont have heroes that jump u from 1000+ range, or first hit bash u, or puke slows and dots onto u and make ur game miserable

Plus u do realize all of this is capped by tinker's mana and that we have lots of defensive items now, yea?
        It’s almost like playing a high skill floor hero should have high rewards
        Don't go against the circlejerk.
    yeah same
    Good riddance to tinker players
    It's not 0 cooldown though, you have to rearm to refresh the cd. So it's more like 3.25/2.25/1.25 s blink hex and shivas and dagon and eblade and laser and missiles and whatever else.
    At best it’s all on a 1.25 second cd bro…
    Might as well remove every remotely unique hero in the game then. Lets make Invoker 4 spell hero, make illusion heroes not able to control their illusions, completely rework meepo, remove global port from furion... we can go on. Lets homogenize the game, every hero gets a dash, short stun, a nuke and some random ult! fun!
        Refreshing items, which are balanced around having certain cooldown, is fundamentally broken. "Broken" and "unique" are pretty different things
Edit: to clarify, I say "broken" as "nigh on impossible to properly balance", not as "too strong"
            I mean if the hero is broken then why don’t the pros pick/ban it every game?
The core concept of the hero sounds broken but he’s like any other unique hero in the game! He has a set of weakness that you can exploit hence why the hero doesn’t have a 100% winrate! Just cause some players get rekt every once in a hundred game by a tinker doesn’t mean we should just erase the identity of the hero!
                I mean "broken" as "nigh on imbossible to properly balance", not as "too strong"
                    Just remove his shield and get his old kit back! Laser, rocket and march or some shit! The hero is balanced without having that shield! You jump him once without his shield and he’s a sitting duck! He’s not impossible to play against as most players moan about!
                        Ya it's easier to balance old tinker( without shield ) than new tinker.
            I get you guys don't like Tinker, but pretending like he was even remotely good, let alone broken, is just total insanity.
                I mean "broken" as "nigh on imbossible to properly balance", not as "too strong"
                    Yeah, 65% winrate and 35% winrate are both broken.
    Skill issue
    Self refreshing ulty that refreshed it all was too much AND THEY KNOW IT!
    Fuck you too fucking Adam.
        Nah, Tinker deserved this fr. Plenty of other heroes needed this treatment, though, to be fair
            he was trash last patch and now he has literally a 32% global winrate today xdd
Tinker now has 26.2% winrate, down from 51.8%
thank the scripters for this :)
    100% feels like a fix to make it impossible to run 3rd party scripts to automate him.
Tinker's been refreshing items for decades. RIP. Wish they'd found a way to keep that aspect intact.
    I'm surprised how sad this made me. Dota's been in and out of my life for 12 years and even though so much has changed, there has always been pieces that have stayed and made the game feel familiar when I inevitably come back. Tiny would have avatoss. Nature's Prophet would have global TP. Faceless void would single-handedly win games with chronos. And Tinker would be teleporting and blink-walking all over the map. 

It's like shadow fiend stacking souls - not just an ability, but something that defines dota for me. Can't believe it's gone.
        I get it man, rearm was iconic. It was one of the things I’d point to to show how crazy dota abilities are compared to other mobas
            Pour one out for Tinker and Techies
        techies bombs too :(
    > decades

Wait, we're not that old yet, right? Right???
        I've started playing dota about 20 years ago.
            Oh man, I even know this is true since you were the one who originally worked with me to make the player-colored teleports.  I remember I stitched together something with an ill-fitting texture and instead you made the default blue TP effect to be white so that it could be colored properly.  This name is a blast from the past
                Oh boy I remember you! Well the interaction, not the nickname tbh. Good old times!
                Ooooh people from the playdota forum!! I wish it still existed for viewing :-( lol

=


Good memories in the suggestions forum and in dotachat threads...
            Fuck man, it really has been 20 yrs WTF
    they could have added increasing mana cost when refreshing consecutively like some heroes in lol.
    Refresher Tinker :)
        Lmao
    It is DEAD DEAD. I have maybe 3k games with him including my previous accs and dota1, but it was all for nothing. Tinker is dead and I guess I wont play this game soon either
        nobody will be missing you, adios
        ok no probs see you

  
[signup.leagueoflegend.com](http://signup.leagueoflegend.com) this is where u belong
            this is a truly nonsense response in this context lol
            You got it the wrong way around, if you can't handle the game having unique heroes that require you to adapt the way you play, then maybe this game ain't for you.
                Bruh, dude is disgusting tinker spammer using smurf accounts and when the hero gets a rework he don't want to play dota anymore.

And it's the other guy who can't handle adapting? xD
                    Smurfs will Smurf regardless, a cool and unique hero completely losing it's core identity isn't going to stop that
            Yeah, someone likes unique as fuck heroes, so they obviously belong in a MOBA where every hero has the same 3 spells + a random ult xd
                Unique heroes that hold all other 9 players. So fun.
            Out of you two, you're the one that is no dota player
Rest in Peace Tinker 21.10.2004 - 23.5.2024.
This was too much imo. 

I know people don't like Tinker but killing the uniqueness of the game is killing the essence of Dota, 

Old Techies, Tinker, Arc, Meepo, Invoker aren't just the most unique dota heroes, they're the most unique MoBA heroes. I am neither Tinker nor Texhies player and hate these heroes as much as the next person but that doesn't mean I wanted them totally gone. 

Techies is another nuker now, Tinker....I don't know what he is anymore.
    We have 9 slots!

Imagine farming enough to fill them all!
        Someone said 13. 6 inventories, 3 backpacks, 1 neutral, and 3 consumable items. A good patch to be a Techies player.
            Neutral works in backpack as well soooo.
                That sounds really busted. I think they're gonna limit that with only the neutral item slot working for neutral items or at least only 1 other neutral item in the backpack can work.
            Before we had bagpack I was parking couriers to swap, eblade dragon hex with shiva manta miljnor. You dominate a creep to tp to. Bot dagger and soul ring are the core then bottle at home to regen.
            It ain't a good patch to be a techies player ever since they reworked him to generic bomberman
                Ain't that the truth, brother.
                    Truer words have never been spoken.
        It’s massive for laning stage. You can start 6 branches (300 gold) tango, sentry, and two mangos *and not have to swap out your stats*. Starting 6 all stats while actively using regen is kinda insane.
        I'd take the old Techies but with only 3 active slots instead of this abomination any day
    That’s been my biggest complaint about the direction that Dota has been moving in for the past few years. I’m not a fan of the homogenization of all the unique heroes. Refreshing spells/items was the core identity of the hero.I never really played old techies or tinker but whenever I played against it I didn’t start whining like you see most redditors doing. In my opinion if you hate a hero with such a passion like that you’re only going to lose to it more because you’re just immediately tilting yourself the instant you play against it.
    Agreed, it saddens me how people dont really appreciate Dota's more unorthodox designs anymore. 10 years ago people would often point to heroes like these as an example of how out there dota's designs could get while still being one of the most well balanced competitive games.
    Agree with you. Tinker is one of my favorite heros to ban. I don't even like him in my team.

But killing the unique heroes isnt cool
    having a hero that's this polarizing is always bad design, they solved techies, now they're working on tinker, who's next on the menu? who knows, but it's always good for the game

a hero can have an "identity" without the remaining 9 players wanting to kill themselves while playing in a match with it
        TBH I feel like tinker was solved years ago and the community just has some weird legacy hate boner. March is (was) gone, missile range nerfed, blink damage CD reset gone, and rearm has a CD. From all the posts on this thread you'd think tinker is solo killing people without ever entering vision and is impossible to catch and lock down, which makes me think nobody on here has played vs a tinker in like 3 years?
            This kind of thing happens all the time here. 6.83 was a full decade ago and people still act like Sniper and Troll Warlord are plaguing their every waking moment
            No man he was still gigantic cancer. The rearm for items was always the issue which is why they brought back march. Blinking around like a spastic constantly spamming nukes was bad enough but late game when he got hex and was able to permanently disable someone until death was pure horror show. It doesn't matter that it was rare to get to that point you only needed to experience it once to forever want to do horrible things to anyone who picks tinker. Same exact feeling for old techies actually, just two heroes that were fundamentally flawed and needed to be changed for the sanity of the player base. Thankfully I don't believe there are any heroes like that left so we can all exist in harmony :)
                But high mobility and disables / solo kill potential aren't unique to tinker at all, and he actually requires more farm and levels to get to that point. His chain hex solo kills are very slow and give a teammate plenty of time to save you. Plenty of heroes jump around as much or more than tinker in a fight, and like half the hero pool can stun and kill you 100-0 in the duration of that stun. IDK why these things are only bad when tinker does them.
                    You are totally right, I don't know why you're getting so many downvotes. People have such an irrational hatred for Tinker. I feel like it was the old March of the Machines that made it oppressive, because he would be taking all the farm on the map, blinking around in the trees and it would be so hard to catch out a good player doing it.  


Tinker farmed so slowly without march and then also had his laning gutted with the cast range nerfs, so it took so much to get to the point where you could chain hex someone, you'd be useless for the first 20 minutes trying to get to shiva before you could even start farming, while the enemy mid could be controlling the tempo of the game. So if you let an enemy tinker get to the point where he can perma hex in the last patch, then you've somehow seriously messed up your game, much like if you let an AM get to the point where he can blink abyssal and solo kill you.
                        man im a tinker player and this is so true. after the last patch i could BARELY play him effectively. even my duo had to tell me tinker is a dead hero. and to nerf him even more AFTER that is wild
                        ty lol. The complaints I hear about this hero just feel completely detached from reality. Like how often does anyone actually get chain-hexed to death in 2024? I'm a (former) tinker spammer and permahex solo kills are something that happens like once every 10-15 games, it really isn't even a significant part of the hero.
                        > You are totally right, I don't know why you're getting so many downvotes.

OP probably got more downvotes than the number of times I've saw Tinker being picked in pubs and pro games combined since the laser nerf.
        It’s only good for the game until they get your hero.
        Fixed techies? They killed techies. What we have now is just another nuker supp hero. 

If this goes on, Dota will become LoL.
            well then we'll at last be rid of you clowns thinking "gamebreaking gimmick = hero identity" because dota will be "LoL"
                Techies and tinker have never been gamebreaking though, what are you spouting?
                    having to balance items around them being refreshable infinitely by a single character is not gamebreaking at all true
                    they just make the other 9 people wanna kill themselves. bad techies means 4v5, also people already complain how hard going HG now and techies is one of the HG king. most of the player is like 3k ish, and we are just not good enough to do it and fun enough to do it
                There was nothing game breaking about either techies or tinker. Ik you people consider this a "hot take" but I hated heroes like Riki, Sniper, Zeus way more than I ever hated Techies. He was never that broken as people claim he was.
                    nobody said techies was broken, just that it used to suck the fun out of the game for other people
                        like faceless void, legion commander, fucking marci, the list goes on.  guess we need to rework these heroes too
                            We didn't have a situation where a large majority of the player base (both new and old) hated any of the heroes that you mentioned. How can you compare legion or Marci to old techies who literally needed a unique exclusion to reports so that those playing them wouldn't get banned 
                                says a lot more about the people reporting techies than anything else
                            With these heroes at least not everyone on the map in the opposite team has to play a completely different game specifically designed to deal with that hero to have a chance of winning the game.
                                actually, in fact, that is exactly what these heroes do.
                                And what is the issue with that? There are, or at least used to be quite a few heroes like that: alchemist, brood, np, all the heroes that would hunt you down like nyx, riki, legion. Tinker and techies were not unique in that.
                            uh, no?
                                [uh, no?](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dota2_gamepedia/images/1/1d/Vo_monkey_king_monkey_ability2_09.mp3) (sound warning: Monkey King)

                    Tinker and Witch Doc, almost 20 years of pure hatred
                        At least witch doctor doesn't force you to play a completely different game of Dota just because he is in the game. Strong and you sometimes feel helpless against him? Yes. Can he routinely kill your entire team if you don't manage to chainstun him? No. At least his abilities have a cooldown.
                            I have nothing against wd but aghs death ward is maybe the best spell in the game for killing your entire team if you cant chain stun him lol
    I won't miss the old tinker. Fck the tinker smurfs and cheaters.
    Dude everyone hates on tinker since he dropped in W3 dota
    None of these heroes are the "most unique" (which doesn't mean anything) moba heroes when you compare them to like a a fifth of the roster in HotS, a couple of league champs, and literally some of *this dota patch's heroes.* Arc and invoker are quite special, and always have been, and current meepo is far more interesting than old meepo ever was. you could argue that techies, and now tinker, have lost core elements of their flavor (and I would indeed argue that for techies), but many, many heroes have gained these over time. Look at old centaur vs. now for a great example - current centaur is quite simple, but still has so much more flavor and synergy in his kit than he ever used to have back in the day.

Tinker is another nuker now too. The two main turret heroes, sniper and zeus, both gained mobility and defensiveness and no longer have that glass cannon feel to them. Tinker might now be that glass cannon, and I for one am excited.
        Did you miss the part where he doesn’t refresh items anymore? You’re not bursting anybody with this hero that stands in place and channels for 3 seconds to do 300 damage
    Exactly this. I don't want every hero to become more similar like league. Unique heroes like that are part of what makes dota feel special.
    > they're the most unique MoBA heroes

Cho'gall, Lost Vikings, and Abathur from HotS are arguably more unique
        wtf they do? is hots still active?
        abathur is just Yuumi, but with somehow even more dogshit design
    Nope, Techies is the easiest example I'll go after. Old techies was fun for one person in a 5v5 game mode. Your team hated you because the playstyle meant they play 4v5 and you drag the game out for no reason. The other team hates you because your mines required 100g sentries to spot and gave 0 reward allowing you to drain supports of gold. The hero was unfun to play with or against and should have never been ported in the first place. 


Every other hero you mentioned is pretty much the same either they were garbage or gaming breakingly OP and just not fun to play against. That's terrible hero design no matter how unique the hero is to you.
    I’m still sad about Old Techies. A good techies will win the game, a bad one will just delay it.
    Mate i literally remember when techies came out.

Techies did not create or contain the essence of Dota.

In fact goofy ass shit that makes the game unplayable is what kills the enjoyment of dota.

What is the point of strategy when someone plants 50 mines in one spot while afk.

What is the point of strategy when someone has no cool downs in their ability.

And meepo was literally buffed because he wasn't getting played so if he's not getting played what part of dota is reliant on him ?

You are literally speaking on hindsight but the players speak and ask about these changes.
You are not the majority
I'm open to redesigning heroes entirely but I want part of them to keep the spirit of the hero and I feel like this was a poorly designed change. I don't think the folks that made it "get" tinker if that makes sense.
Ultra late game Tinker with Arcane blink + Wind waker gets a 2.8 (2.1 with octarine) blink cd and 2.5 sec invulnerability. It's not as good aggressively because you can't perma hex and burst someone with a eb dagon but it might be a playstyle.

Still a wild change and especially removing his missiles. His signature missile launcher has no purpose now.
    The missiles are the weirdest part to me. Cosmetics aside, now he’s just a glorified (yet also much worse) Nature’s Prophet
First techies, now tinker
    Next will be our beloved invoker
        Soon NP won't be able to teleport
I hope he stays down.
That hero is just annoying.
    I knew when they came for my Goblins they'd do this to tinker one day.  

I was sad the day they killed the goblins but knew it had to be done.  

I hope tinker players realize this in time
        well idk playing them aggressively was really fun
        “I did not speak up for… because I was not a…”

Moment for the dota 2 community.

Screaming crying shaking throwing up
            At this point I wonder who's next? Both of my mains Techies and Dazzle are completely destroyed and have been for years(I haven't played in like 2 years at this point I think). Now Tinker and Arc are getting gutted. Nature's Prophet got gutted a bit ago too.


They'll probably go for all the summoner/illus heroes next like PL, Naga, Chen. Either that or they'll start nerfing globals even more like Zeus or Spirit Breaker.


The Techies players warned them, but Reddit is just celebrating as Dota becomes a hollowed shell of what it once was.
        Theyve "killed" tinker before tho. People said the same thing when they took March away the first time. They will probably rebalance him over the next few patches and he will be just as cancer as before
            March isn't nearly as important to the hero, both in terms of balance and *fun/design,* as Rearm was. Pretty much all of Tinker's basic abilities could be swapped out and he'd still have what made Tinker special if he kept Rearm.
                Okay but that wasnt my point at all.

My point was, pivotal parts of Tinkers kit have been renoved/changed like this before and he still wrapped back around to what we had for him before this patch. Now MoM is back, all the people who thought that was gone forever are wrong too.

If this version of Tinker isnt functional/fun anymore theyll adjust him again.
        Also killed arc, lone druid, and most heroes that were hard to master but extremely  impactful. They want it to turn into league of legends and have been doing it for at least 4 years now.
        Iconic or not, it was bad for the game and only got worse when they released windwaker and new shivas. I think boots of bearing was a secret tech too right?


I think people will figure out how to abuse this new iteration and we'll be surprised anyone complained.
This is kind of a wild change. Maybe if they amped his inate to per 2 intelligence instead of 4 it might be more acceptable... Never has a hero been so truly destroyed in a patch. I've never found him oppressively strong since the rocket range nerf.
I know that people hate Tinker with a passion, but this change to rearm is like removing poisons from Venomancer or silences from Silencer, there's no point in having this hero in the game anymore.

Dota 2 has always been a wild game, and heroes like tinker rearming his items added flavor.

Very strange change.
    Techies players right now being like "We warned you."
    He still has the identity of having no cd spells which is cool. And late game he still gets really low item cd's, just no perma hex/blink. Like the other reworks this is simply version 1.0 and will be updated and buffed accordingly as he has way more design space to work with now, like techies with 9 item slots (could you imagine that with the old one?). One idea is giving him more spells to play with something in-between invoker and the usual 4 ability pleb
        His blink facet is not a replacement though - 300 distance is nothing and you're being attacked whenever it triggers. So now he not only has no mobility, he also has no movement speed and no survivability (no free magic resistance and no extra armor).

All this means is he'll be buffed in two weeks.
            Maybe they might even buy boots on tinker
This is an admition of valve that they are not capable of designing balancing items with tinker in the game. Could have seen this last patch with how they changed tinker with lens changes. Or the whole dagger mute fiasco.

Kinda called the change as a joke of not resetting items, but i imagined they would give innate blink ability.

RIP in peace tinker bros
    Oooh, they finally missed. Rip my lovely missiles. Today is truly the saddest I've ever been about dota in more than 17 years.
    > not capable of designing balancing items with tinker in the game

Nothing about Tinker was ever broken, Reddit just likes to complain because the average 2k player can't find Eul's in the shop
        Sure, but they are limited on new item designs because tinker will refresh them. Or they need to add can not be refreshed by rearm to everything
            > Or they need to add can not be refreshed by rearm to everything

They already did that for every single neutral item, since they couldnt balance them around rearm.

Might as well do that for 'broken' regular items with rearm as well, just like they've already done for e.g. midas and bkb.
        after the techies rework, tinker was the only character that warped the way the game played, it went from dota 2 to kill the tinker before he kills your entire team from 3 screens away
            This isn’t true Nyx warps the game massively.
                as does axe, lc, faceless void, np, silencer, the list goes on
            Bro storm/spec/void literally exists, dont tell me abt tinker blinking in just like any other hard carry in lategame
            Tinker doesn't warp any game more than other carries, people who actually turn on their monitors for the first 15 mins of the game take the free win.
            Nature's prophet? Brood mother? Arc warden before this patch? All of these hereos drastically change the way the game is played. NP even more so then Techies
        It's because of that lv 25 DMG talent. More items to buy for machine gun techies I guess haha
This is a good change, now they can actually buff him to make him viable. Refreshing items is just too broken, we saw it with Dazzle too. Maybe give Tinker a blink spell or something, but perma-hexing somebody is not healthy for the game.
    If he gets a blink spell it would be very strong. Unless you mean working like blink dagger where it gets disabled on player dmg.

Honestly that'd be hilarious if he gets blink dagger as a spell since he already gets travels for free now. 😂
        Blink ability with damage lock instead of travels will be fine though
    Tinker's been both OP and shit while being able to rearm items, nothing inherently broken about it. Stunlocking people to death is a core part of dota and like half the hero pool can do it, I have no idea why being hexed and lasered for 10 seconds is unhealthy but punching someone to death inside Chrono is fine.
        Not a counter point but your exemple is not really good.

Chrono has cooldown, Tinker has literally no cooldown (pls watch kiyotaka) with his deadly combo. Thats why he get nerf, a full item Tinker can kill litteraly a whole team and you can do nothing about it (again, pls watch kiyotaka, in a pro game...)
            You daft mate? That pro game kiyotaka played is not the last version of Tinker before 7.36. Please collect your marbles before you go bankrupt.
            Just seemed like the most obvious example of long stun leading to death. You can also be 100-0 stunned+bursted by ck, sven, nyx, lina, tiny, etc. Basically any snowballing bursty core or any farmed pos 1 with an abyssal will stun and kill you. The chain hexing is actually much weaker than these examples because it gives teammates tons of time to save the person being hexed. Permahex is one of those things that sounds crazy OP on paper but in practice is not nearly that strong. There's a reason hex is only a lategame luxury option for tinker, not a core item.

The nerf definitely isn't balance-motivated since tinker was already bad. It's an attempted rework and I guess valve didn't put enough thought into counteracting this change with other buffs.

Kiyotaka is arguably the best tinker player in the world, and that team almost never played tinker. He's basically unplayed in pro games, so using a single example of a good tinker performance isn't very convincing. After all, a full item void can also kill a whole team while you do nothing about it, and we actually see that happen all the time.
        Void is super strong late-game but you still get to play the game. There's counter-play.

Previous tinker was literally a timer on the match. You had to hunt him down and abuse him early game and end the match before he got fully online. Once he was fully online with enough networth he literally could 1v9 and auto win if you knew what you were doing on the hero with 0 counterplay. That's not a healthy design.
            Simply not true tbh. You can save allies being hexed many ways, and any single disable puts rearm on CD and cancels blink, so you can dogpile tinker and kill him. Tinker is v strong lategame but not moreso than any other carry. The only thing that really comes close to what you're describing is a PL vs no AoE.
    I have an idea, let's replace his first skill with impale, his second with a targeted slow, his third with a passive that boost magic dmg, and his ult with a targeted nuke!
    >not healthy for the game.

I hate this argument
Zero skill players rejoicing now
AAAHHHHHH THEY NEVER MISS
I’m no tinker player, I thought he was always annoying, but this saddens me. One of the things I like about dota is that the hero concepts are unique, and somewhat specialized to certain niches. It feels like we’re losing that to more generalists, where everybody has a jump, a slow, and a nuke. I will miss tinker and techies.
Good fuck this hero...refresh your hex dagon now filthy tinker pickers!
    Dagon tinker isnt even a thing now

Says a lot
        What do you expect from low skill whinners?
            I mean many people in pubs(high immortal) also don't know how to deal with good tinkers, on low mmrs it's even more prevalent, cause they can't pressure tinker enough before he can perma hex you.
                And mid ladder tinkers suck ass
as a tinker and techies enjoyer, with lvl 25 and lvl 30 respectively, this hurts. the last time i felt this pain was when they removed remote mines, that was 2 years ago. damn.



both heroes have mostly been dogshit on higher mmr lobbies, but somehow the little guys keep complaining about them
    I miss the green mines too. Techies was a Buffet like investor back then - invest time & mana to mine choke points, inside trees, etc. and reap the compounded rewards later. They had nerfed tinker already before and this just kills the hero. 

They did this to meepo as well in a way, his aghs used to give extra meepo so your 15-16 min aghs would give you massive powerspike with rosh potential. Now you wait for levels and the extra meepo comes in at level 25. Not to mention, they removed his extra passive magic resistance which was needed because the hero can't go bkb.

Reddit will find some other hero to cry about and we'll see it get nerfed as well.
        >They did this to meepo as well in a way, his aghs used to give extra meepo so your 15-16 min aghs would give you massive powerspike 

did you miss the part where it now gives you a much better powerspike in being able to scoop up all your meepos?
            >did you miss the part where it now gives you a much better powerspike in being able to scoop up all your meepos?

I don't like megameepo. It has it's uses against certain heroes but it is hardly the powerspike. You'd do better with disperser or skadi.
What a time to be alive
Now I have one more ban slot because thinker doesn't need to be banned anymore, win / win, ty volvo
    Imagine wasting a slot on a hero that was never picked before the patch anyway.
Good riddance. 

Game just got a little bit better.
hes genuinely totally dogshit rn. 32% winrate across all brackets right now.

maybe theres something there but i really dont see it. theres nothing you can buy!
    Hear me out. If the game was just played as a 4v5, I'm not even sure if the 4 players will have lower than 32% winrate. Talking about pubs I mean.

Maybe the best Tinker build is rush disconnect into abandon.
        I've never seen a win rate this bad since I started playing in 2012. lowest was brood at like 35% at one point
            One player out of ten, presumably trying their best to win, can somehow lower their entire team's winrate by 18% in favor of the opponent simply by picking a certain hero. Imagine if someone described this situation to you and asked you to envision what kind of hero that player picked. With that kind of a swing, I'd have to start guessing the hero had a kit that actively sabotaged their own team or something.

This is an extremely funny scenario if it wasn't also reality.
    yep, patch less than 12 hours, determine what hero is dogshit.
        The hero was completely dogshit before patch and on the eye test the patch just took a piss on an already rotting corpse.
            when I checked last patch he was top 8 winrate in ancient just a few weeks ago
    good
    Where do you see this wr ?
    This is just completely unfair.
        nah, being hexed for 15 seconds getting 100-0'd is unfair, this is called balance
            Getting chronoed for 10 seconds with refresher void is also unfair lmao! But there’s a way to not get chronoed for 10 seconds and that is to not let void get farmed six slotted! Lmao

I do agree that tinker was somewhat unbalanced but half of yall need to stop complaining like late game tinker is some insanley overpowered hero that can 1v5!
            All they needed to fix that was add escalating mana costs for all spells/items. Just like dazzle ult. I'm not a tinker player but this change isn't justified.
        Git gud, kek.
This puts a smile on my face 😈
Good riddance
Good
He's perma banned anyway
Isn't Tinker at like a sub 40% win rate right now? I don't mind it because fuck Tinker pickers, but still... He got rekt.
Yet another one of the reasons Dota was unique is dead. I thought allowing what made a hero OP to stay OP while nerfing what surrounds it was the general philosophy. I don't like this at all. 

I'm not a Tinker player but I was a Naga player, I was a Techies player, I was a Dusa player, I was a Morphling player.
I'm about to get downvoted to oblivion for this, but Tinker's Rearm nerf is too much.

Ok I guess it's annoying when they keep blinking from one spot to another, but maybe at least allow him to reduce 50% of the item's cooldown instead.
    >but maybe at least allow him to reduce 50% of the item's cooldown instead.

This would also essentially remove the hero from the game, so I'm indifferent between it and what they actually did.
Yep non-tinker crybaby players won.
Hahahahah fuck tinker spammers lmao
Yeah they killed my favourite hero. Please fix the dagger at least Valve. You just can't delete the core aspect of the hero. :(
What a joyous day 🥰
Delete that trash hero. Pure cancer like meepo and morphing.
    Awww the 2/3 games a week guy can’t figure out how to counter tinker, must mean hero is dog shit broken. Is your night light also made by Valve?

I dont even play dota for few years and im mad
Genuine question how to play tinker this patch? You get blink octarine and some int item? All of tinker item now looks like cosmetic to me absolutely useless.
    >how to play tinker this patch

haha, you don't.
        First techies tears, now tinkers tears. How good does it feel. 

They said techies is dead. Now is better the he ever was. And its actually fun to play, unless you wanted to play rts. Same with arc, broken bullshit, now he is really well done. And tinker will be probably the same.
            >doesn’t know how to counter tinker
>makes no effort to learn tinker or how difficult the hero was to play effectively
>probably plays 2-3 hours of dota a week at most

“This patch will help tinker guys just like techies you wait and see!” Scripts didnt ruin tinker or techies. Clowns like you that cant even figure out how to play against it did. Seriously, all the people thinking this is good: how many games of TURBO did you lose to techies or tinker to come with that conclusion? 

Tinker was an incredibly complex hero to try and make work in certain situations, and still wasn’t even that broken. You 2/3 games a week crowd just ran into a few smurfs, cried to Valve, and once again acting like the spoiled children that you are, nuked another hero into oblivion. But hey, at least your turbo games will be easier now when you get home from work (:
            I’m not Arc Warden main, but explain this to me, why was he was better before.

It feels the same to me, you have more uptime on the Illusion Hero, but you are punished more for fumbling its death.
                Rapier arc meta? Midas-mjolnir-rapier. 

Your main hero safe in base or in friendly jungle. Why you tp with ~500 dmg illu with insane attack speed. All you get for kill is like 300 or something.

Perma pushing you, supports can't deal with it. It was just cancer imho
                    Okay, I quit before that shit happened in 2015 or 2016 or so.
            No, as someone who knows tinker more than myself, no. This hero is in complete garbage right now.
                Techies mains were saying the same things. He will be played differently ofc, but he wont be completly dogshit.
                    it doesn't matter that techies is "good" or "bad", it's that the entire gimmick of techies is gone, it's just a different hero. Sure, they can buff tinker by giving him like +5 armor and +12 base damage, or something, but it's just not the same
                        How good is a hero if it only exist to sit in a glass box for people to say "look how unique that hero is" while he is not played at all. I agree losing the identity of the hero is bad but refusing all changes just for the sake of keeping a unique hero is wrong too. Techies plays differently, but you can still keep some of the identity of the hero in the base defense and map control but now it is played far more than before.
    I haven't tried it only read the notes so far but tbh with the left heal facet and the mana reduction on rearm it's making me think that you might be able to pull out a mean Tinker support? A lot of support items have int on them and lower cooldown on things like force staff, glimmer cape, windwaker, etc. could be very helpful for the team
    as a 4 support spamming shield on your allies and blinding the enemy carry with an aether lens or something idk
Good, all tinkers played deserves it for being such a rat
Shadow deleting the hero
Ripbozo
How about they just return the old rearm mechanic and just reduce skills and item cast ranges for idk 3 seconds? And reduce their damage output like 30%? No? Still imbalanced?
Deserved
Good riddance.
I wish all tinker players a very I hope he's unplayable now
Good riddance, nothing of value was lost.
Rot in hell Tinker players! Woo!
ITT: Crybabies who couldn't deal with a hero with 40% WR rejoicing. Congrats you won.
As a Tinker player, this is an outrage
    Finally, my brother. Today we witnessed our cult destruction.
I feel like this is going to be a case of "Everyone tries building and playing him the way he's always been built and get punished for it. I imagine it still needs some tweaking but I dont think that it will end up obliterating the hero. I played a game of him last night with march heal+defense matrix talents and id drop 3-4x march onto teamfights and defense matrix my teammates. March still shreds like it always has, but now also has a benefit to teammates, healing them for half the damage values as they pass by. The amount of utility in his kit is insane, and there are a few really important things to consider:

1. You arent old tinker anymore, buy boots. 
2. You have so much utility it's unreal. 5 second blind, %HP remover on aghs, heal on march, infinite damage barrier/Status res, warp flare, look at him like he's a new hero and dont get baited into playing him the old way, get creative.
3. You have a proper farming tool again, use it.
4. Solo strength has gone down, but your ability to teamfight is huge still.


Cast range is very important right now. I think that Aether will be essential.

Overall; give it more than a week before you knock it. Some of the strongest heroes after reworks started off with super low winrate, then people started to figure it out and it skyrockets. Go lab some stuff before complaining
Well this is a great day. Fck all the tinker spammers out there.
I'll be honest they can just remove tinker, i cant even describe how much i hate that hero
    That's what they did, didn't you read the patch?
A great day!
Wooooooo. Fuck tinker.
ABSOLUTELY DESERVED, get fucked tinker mains
Finally, inner peace.
Maybe time for tank tinker
Just buy int lol
imagine rearming a fully upgraded dagon 10 times in a tf when it even gets to that point
Give my Dazzle Trinker back
Tinker downgraded to support.
if yesterday you told me I have a choice between "rearm being nerfed on items" and "for the next 3 months every morning you will wake up to a man pissing in your face" i would
Welcome to the club. (Former techies spammer with 3k matches)
Fuck Tinker honestly
They shouldve adapted rearm to do something cool as a replacement. For example by adding a special affect to the next spell he uses in the next second or so after rearm.
genuine question here could he not work as a decent 4 now with shield and laser changes? Is that basically griefing picking him as 4 cause it seems not that bad.
Couldn't care less about Tinker atm. It's Meepo I report when I see cause the hero is just bonkers especially if the guy is booster. You just can't stop him.
    Don’t worry if recent evidence is anything to go by soon meepo will just have illusions or some bullshit
Winrate. 33% .
Tinker is so enraging. Tinker enjoyer begone!
I wish valve was more willing to slowly nudge the annoying heroes into less annoying playstyles, instead of just completely removing what made them unique from the game
dagger cooldown reset was toxic
It's nice to see Tinker getting fucked. They will probably atleast partly bring back old Tinker I am afraid.
thank fucking god
Tinker support is on the menu! Kind of
the lolification begins
got 79.6% winrate with 200 games in tinker in my smurf in 6kmmr it really went downhill when they nerfed him with his casts range in the previous patch. But this current patch I just played League of legends for a while after updating my dota 2 🙂
I'm so happy cause tinker refreshing items made him imbalanced.   Perma hexing people till their dead blinking in and out of range with no counte play after bkb is over and linkens is popped.  

I liked him better as an annoying split pusher anyway
Fk valve
Fk gaben!
After they changed him from laser and rocket + hex and travels I never played him again
I still have the travels on my tinker… waste of a slot and hero now
Not only did they kill the Hero power wise, they killed the fun of playing the hero. Thank god I no longer play this game.
 Ya lame, I like unique heroes not this generic hero they thing seem to be converging toward. 

 Sniper has no range now(until late game)
 Techies is generic nuker
 Tinker is just ..ass..
twas a roller coaster for sure
Another hero gutted for absolutely no reason at all

His [win rate](https://www.dotabuff.com/heroes/tinker/trends) went form 49% to 33%. I don't think even the Techies gutting tanked him that hard. Why the fuck did they do this?
i wished they kept the item refresh in some way, something like  
Rearm - also after using rearm, gain a buff for 7 seconds. during this buff, casting basic spells reduce the cooldown of items by 50% of it's max cooldown

  
so you're forced to use two basic spells to use blink (or any items)
deserved. stay dead
Finally I don’t have to pick night stalkers or silencer against tinker spammers
Watching people uniornically say things like "Tinker is my favorite hero to ban" and "I don't even want Tinker on my team" but then simultaneously end their post with "but we shouldn't change the hero because he's so UNIQUEEEEEE" is really fucking funny and dumb lmao.do y'all hear yourselves? The hero needs changing. His design is busted as fuck. Constantly see-sawing between oppressive and dog shit isn't good design. So let's find a new design for him shall we?
just use the new defense matrix facet to blink :)
I will never forget that one game where I owned the entire early and mid game. Destroyed the enemy offlane and carry. Even killed the mid tinker a bunch of times by playing really well and surprising him. 

Then he got shivas on tinker. 

That was it for me and my team. He literally 1 v 5d us. We would all the other people in his team no problem easy peasy. Then this guy would just kill us all from the trees cos he got last pick tinker. 

I was troll - he made etheral blade to counter me. I surprised him again with an aghs and took his beyond godlike stream. He insta bought back and killed me again cos now I didn't have my bkb. My team was anyways not doing anything to him. 

Ahhh whatever. I only have horrible memories of this hero. Generally played by low level accounts with gifts and rampages. 


So I say that NOTHING OF VALUE WAS LOST!!
This is just sad - speaking as a dirty Tinker spammer since the good old days of TI4. Hardly play anymore due to RL but marks the end of an era :(
I stopped playing dota since PL changes... happier now! Try it.
For everyone else: flip the meme
Honestly i wouldn't mind that if tinker actually tinkers items in the future... where tinker needs to pick an item to be rearmed like the usual in the past.... or if it buffs items or skills... 

really thought we'll see old techies with these facets... thats sad too..
Honestly? Finally, it was broken af.
I thought we were so back. How they gonna tease us then cuck us as hard as ever. Literally awful winrates every patch but still nerfed.
So what does his ult do now?
I would rather have a tinker that does only pure damage, with rockets and march and laser, than have a sniper in the game.
Balanced imo
they got rid of missiles too, so he isn't a nuker too. I guess Tinker support with cd reduction is coming
At least no more missile blinking from everywhere
Make game more noob-friendly plss!!!!
Good that Valve listened to the 1-2k low iq scrubs that been playing this game for 2000 years and still somehow linger in 1k mmr. 

Previous patch, at best mediocre, the hero could be countered by literally anything. Ppl whining about defense matrix and him being able to blink. Whine about anything, yet if I were to put you to play Tinker you would go 0/20 in 30 games in a row. 

Go remove the iconic things that made Dota unique, and make it like the garbage game LoL is (I came from there and I know very well what a garbage MOBA looks like).

I guess it's fine because you know what? In the next few patches you will have the most disgusting edition of Tinker. Marching the entire jgl in less than a minute and when Tinker will have a facet with a blink refresh, then all the low skills players will throw tantrums. 

No aoe laser, need 15. No cd refresh and ppl say yea go max intelligence. *Let's enjoy a game after 60 min ig*

I play him support now, even better seeing 3 enemies picking heroes to counter a Tinker. Can't wait for the perfect OP update that Dusa got after her rework.
[deleted]
    Why dont we just remove AM also? I mean the guy also dictates the tempo of the game by farming for 30 minutes and makes you play 4v5!

While we’re at it lets just ban arc, meepo, morph and huskar! Lmao
        If you would give me a button right now that would delete all these heros from the game permanently, i would press it. 
            if u had that button u would eventually end up deleting \_every\_ hero from the game
                Go play as that melee creep, at least respawn is always 30 seconds or less
            I mean if you want generic heroes with no real identity then there’s another moba right around the corner! Heroes with flashy spells to dash around and have shield/bonus magic damage for set amount of attacks! Not too many active items which lets you focus on your heroes abilities only!
Dota is unique in the sense that not many heroes are homogenous! 

If tinker was some godlike hero that was op from early to late game then sure the hero needs to be removed! But the hero is weak asf till midgame so i dont see the point of moaning too much! 
Definitely gonna get downvoted but it is what it is!
                > I mean if you want generic heroes with no real identity then there’s another moba right around the corner! 

Ahhh the almighty league of legends argument. Dont be on a too high horse mate, dota heros arent that special.

Just because you focus on only 10 heros in dota that have a „special“ design, doesnt make the whole cast special. Dota has more than enough boring as heros. (Like upwards of 70% of all heros). Cant tell me sladar, marci, lc, jakiro, witch doctor, axe, chaos knight, viper, sniper, mars, lion, tide, bounty, crystal, zeus, lich and so many more are any more special than any random league champion. 

On the other hand league also has champions with design totally different from all other champions that stand out. 

This argument is shit tier honestly and the constant shitting on league because of the insecurity of this community gets old fast. Dota is not that special, sorry to tell you bro, it doesnt make you a superior human that you play dota instead of league. Should i tell you a secret, on the league subreddit nobody ever mentions dota cause mobody cares about it, which makes guys like you sound even more like a little bitch for constantly bringing it up.
    > fresher balance

> 33% winrate
    Endlessly hex opponents - yea i sure as hell didnt know tinker had unlimited mana and the ability to turn off the pcs of ur allies so they cant do anything while u got hexed
Good. 

Techies was nerfed into the ground, meanwhile Tinker was and remained the most toxic hero in the game. this is deserved
Might as well delete my boi. All the days spent learning the hero gone just because 90% of the players don't want to put the hours to learn him. Fortune favors the noobs.
    99% Look at the comments
Love to see. Add more salt please!
Good. Hope tinker eating grass for the next 2 years lol.
Good
Good fucking riddence. This is the exact change that I've been asking for for years. Thank you Valve for listening.
Just change to rearm gets disabled upon damage. That's a huge nerf but still retaining the identity of the hero.

Sorry tinker pickers, as a former techies spammer i feel u
Finally I can remove him from my ban list
The only person having fun in a Tinker game is usually the Tinker. It's either a smurf that peaked and has to take it out on lower tiered players or, back in the day, some jerkoff just mindlessly split pushing while listening to I assume Coldplay.
Fukem tinker spammers yo
I hate Tinker but him without dagger reset is just weird
Hope they delete the hero next
too much nerf. at least exclude dagger from the item list that can't be rearmed. Every other item I completely understand but him not being able to dagger in and out of fights just dumpstered him royally. at this point I rather have a support sniper trying to build khanda instead of MiD tinker.
    dagger yeah, but like without soulring refresh he does NOTHING lol
    Sniper with fast shrapnel aspect might actually be not that grief as a support
Nothing of value was lost
i don't even want march back, it's an annoying fucking spell and no one likes it, but he feels so lame without refreshing items
    Yep. I think the march change was good. It made the hero less turtle-y/greedy and encouraged fighting at lower net-worth. Without considering balance, modern Tinker prior to this patch was more fun.
4 wins in a row so far with him. So yeah. No issues yet. Just don’t blink in like a dumbass. 🙃
    Dotabuff link?
    So what's the new play style?
        You're a utility team fighter. He's not going to run over you alone with str blink shivas like before, but win by having better cds and working with his team. Windwaker + matrix for save. It goes to around 5-6 second cd once you're 6 slotted. Lazer anybody that goes on your melee cores, warp flare anybody that goes on you. Nobody can fight into march. Hex on a 6 second cd. Yes they killed the old annoying chain hex identity (which im sad about too) but replaced with the most obnoxious area denial + utility probably ever conceived
            Before you couldn't refresh linkens... Now it's on a 4 sec cd with 250 int lolol
THANK GOD the hero is dead.

THANK GOD!
I hate tinker but I think that fucker doesn't deserve this identity thief
Literally takes the tinker out of tinker
Good riddance, fuck tinker players.
Hero is unpickable now IMO. I already wasn't a fan of the rework that removed March, but then no Rearming items just put the final nail in the coffin (even though we got March back).

I'd love to see pros prove me wrong on this, but not being able to Rearm Blink just seems to completely dumpster the hero and make you totally useless to your team.
good.
Good riddance, thank god!
THANK GOD, playing against tinker is so miserable, so much effort to catch the scroat
why are people in this thread act like tinker wasn't broken? Guys tinker's nerfed for a reason
    well he was actually dogshit after all the nerfs (he lost 1500 cast range from rocket ffs)

but even when he wasn't dogshit he wasn't actually that good, people just have bad memories from times when they were seriously out of position (and they probably didn't even realize it since most people have the strategic capacity of a gold fish) or they/their team mates had no idea how to play vs him

where are the tinkers endlessly hexing players in pro games if i am wrong?  it's very rare
        Yea right? If Tinker was that broken, why isn't he spammed in every single pro game and TI?

He's literally a noob killer but the irony is lost on the people complaining about the hero lol.
    How was Tinker even broken?
    32% winrate hero = "broken" - Reddit users.
Repeating what I said to the other thread,

Good riddance. You tinker mains don't deserve sympathy. :)
    >Techies flair

You out of all the people should feel sympathy towards Tinker getting half-way lobotomised, just like Techies was.
Good. Let him stay in the trash heap he belongs to. I'd rather not relive the days of players spamming him with his 0 cooldown dagon fucking shenanigans
Yeah fuck this hero, i hope i don't ever see it again
Heh don't worry. they did also made arc warden temprest into a punishable if it dies once. But aside from both heroes getting nerf. it highly depends if you can adopt the patch and you might get used to it
    arc is arguably stronger now, chosing your version, longer clone. and yet more counterplay, more incentive to kill solo clone, good stuff tbh. and high apm players will have something to play
March of the Machines is now only in a radius around tinker, isn't it? It's very different from before, we got it back with a monkey's paw wish
Can't wait for reddit tears after two letter patches, when he gets 'compensated' with some buffs, trying to push hg or tf into tinkers march of the machines spam. People seem to have forgotten what annoying actually means aka old old tinker.
I'm a casual Dota 2 gamer with well over 3k hours over the past 6-8 years, from first hand experience, theres always an extraordinary Tinker spammer smurf in almost every single ranked and unranked game for me at least, haven't had good consistent fun for years in Dota. I'm stoked on this change.
    Post dotabuff. Would love to see how much heavy lifting the word “almost” is doing there. Is 4% of games “almost every single one”?
    So you’ve had almost 3k games against a tinker and still can’t counter or play against him? 

Tinker is the 94th most popular hero right now in dotabuff! Stop spouting nonsense just cause hating on this hero is a popular opinion lmao
god bless, fuck that cancerous piece of shit hero. hope he stays dead and never comes back.
Good riddance.
Finally. After techies the second mech unit is finally less cancer.
I see this as an absolute win
Deleting Dota. Fuck this, I spent so many countless hours to get good at tinker, now it's all useless. This ruins the implicit contract with the game that if you spend time learning a unique difficult hero, it won't be for nothing. 

This is like making lone druid have no items on bear, making arc warden have no items on clone, or make meepo have no abilities on clone. Don't spend time getting good on difficult hero because they might just delete what makes them unique. Anyone complaining about tinker could learn to play him. 

Rearm wasn't even such a good ability. You could see in ability draft that rearm has 40% win rate, it is very weak ultimate, only with the kit of tinker it works. 

P.S. is there any active version of the game where tinker is still as before? Dota1 maybe?
Fuck yes! To hell with this stupid blinking perma hex and shiva so called "hero". In low bracket this was the second worst smurf hero who would regularly have a k/d along the lines of 30/1 and is literally impossible to deal with without stuns of some kind or full team commitment.
