His identity is butchered and forever gone. It doesn't matter if they buff his spells to a broken level in the future. I wonder what unique dota heroes will they streamline to league level next? Invoker, meepo, chen maybe? Letyjust remove the unique things about them.
Every time people say this shit the hero ends up broken. I remember people crying about the brood rework and in to time it was a first ban
    This is different. They might buff tinker to a viable or broken level in the future, but the concept of the hero is already butchered and his identity is just gone. What do you want next? Invoker with 4 spells only? Meepo merges into 1 unit forever? This is just not dota design.
I can't believe valve actually cowed to all the people whining about tinker. What makes dota a unique and interesting game is how cool some of the kits are - rearm as a concept being one of them. I'm not a tinker player at all, I've been stomped by some frustratingly good tinkers, but at least I appreciate the hero as a concept and the skill people had to master it. 

Now it's gutted and in the dumpster. I truly hope they make rearm work on items again, not to make the hero better, but to live up to our expectation of having cool and unique hero designs.
    They didn't cowered to anything..... They have their own minds that just aligned to people's complain.
        They're active reading reddit and get feedback and advice from here. Honestly there's a vocal minority of people that just want to see tinker deleted from the game. 

They cowed to the whiners, trying to make people happy over making the game interesting. Now we have a non-interesting non-hero. Even if they buffed the shit out of it dota has lost a part of what makes it a unique game.

Like, imagine if they removed all micro and summons because people were complaining a ton on reddit. Or if they removed meepo clones. It might make some people happy but it removes the soul from dota.
Tinker was already dead, dont know why they had to mutilate his corps.
    52% wr mid in d2pt over 1000 games. Wdym he was already dead, do you even check stats? His winrate in dota plus stats was also pretty high. Just played with one in my team yesterday and he was a menace to the enemy team in 5k avg
        52% is not good at all for a specialist hero. Heroes like Meepo, Arc Warden, and Tinker should have really high winrate in pubs if they're balanced. They're last pick niche heroes typically played by people who spam them. If someone has 1000 games on Tinker and their winrate on that hero is roughly the same as if their other significantly less played heroes, then it's an indication that Tinker is too weak, because that player is way better at Tinker than they are at other heroes.

There's a reason why Tinker hasn't seen competitive play for a long time now.
            Tinker wasn't played in pro games even when Kiyotaka was 1v9ing and solo winning for his team, so that argument isn't valid. 

Also dead hero shouldn't have 52% winrate in high immortal bracket with 1k+ games last 10 days. 

Also I've played with and against tinker last patch so im not just judging by stats only.
                >Tinker wasn't played in pro games even when Kiyotaka was 1v9ing and solo winning for his team, so that argument isn't valid. 

Are you talking about the Berlin Major that happened over a year ago and well before all his spell ranges got completely dumpstered? Do you want to count how many times heroes like Timbersaw and Lesh got picked since then? One guy in the entire world had one good pro game over a year and like 3 major nerfs ago last picking Tinker against a comp with a single silence/stun between 5 heroes. How does bringing this up do anything but reinforce my point?

>Also dead hero shouldn't have 52% winrate in high immortal bracket with 1k+ games last 10 days. 
>Also I've played with and against tinker last patch so im not just judging by stats only.

Show me some games you've played on Tinker in the last patch then. I think you haven't even touched the hero because you don't seem to appreciate how crushing of a nerf 450 laser range is.
        >52% wr mid in d2pt over 1000 games. Wdym dead, do you even check stats? His winrate in dota plus stats was also pretty high. Just played with one in my team yesterday 

Uh he got reworked a matter of hours ago
            No bro, the guy said tinker was already dead and im saying he wasn't. Right now idk if he's dead or not for sure
Same thoughts the 1st time techies was reworked. Same name but technically different hero and probably a new playstyle
Might feel a bit weird, tinker is no longer Tinker. I remember when I first played DotA, a guardian tinker kept killing me for months in lobbies, didn't even know anything about the hero. Now the only hero who gets to refresh most things is dead, was so challenging to kill.
I swear, all you guys jumping to conclusions a few hours into the patch are dumb af
Tinker be support now.
Took me hundreds of hours to learn this hero. So high learning curve and then one day. All the discipline and hard work is of no use. Countless hours of learning drained down the gutter.
    Bind rearm on 3, buy bottle, soulring, blink, shiva. Press 12345 and repeat until end of the game. I don't see how this is any more difficult than playing something like Windranger.
        I don't think is fair to compare windranger and tinker in skill usage complexity at all, sounds like you never played tinker at high level. 

Sure people aren't over there using scripts to play WR, cause is not really difficult :)

Just tinker constant blink positioning alone while in a TF requires a lot of spatial awareness, especially in early/early-midgame when the hero is so frail even with status resistance and damage absorption from Defensive Matrix. Then you have other 4 to 5  itens to spam in a specific sequence to get the most of it, plus all your abilities. Is really easy to mess up with your skills if you don't know what you are doing compared to most heroes. A good tinker player simply just doesn't stop pressing the keyboard for the entirety of the game.
Dude it’s literally impossible to do anything as tinker. You deal 0 damage outside and if you join inside fights you deal mediocre damage at best and die 2 seconds later. It’s honestly insane. Blink isn’t even an option anymore for him. Slow farm too, weird facets, idk man
from the new patch it seems the hero became a specific antipush role hero now
Fucking finally. No more russian script kiddies abusing this shit.
Pos4 flash farming hero could be
you misspelled it, let me help you  RIPBOZO
fuck tinker
I stopped playing the game for a bit. What is the purpose of rearm now? What exactlt would we be channelling it for?
    It Refresh abilities only, not items. They also replaced heat seeking missiles with march of the machines. The inly interaction he has with items now is his innate. For every 4 intelligence he reduces the cooldown of items by 1% up to maximum of 60 %
        Ah thanks
