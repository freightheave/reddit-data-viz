Replace the obfuscated OAuth access strings in comment_extractor.py with actual ones from reddit if you want to run them again.

comment_extractor takes input of URL codes
    e.g. "1cynbb3" from "https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/1cynbb3/tinker_is_no_more_gentlemen/"
and extracts comments from the post.
